The organization that I am going through is IVHQ volunteering. The things that I need to pay for is for my airfare, which is where the majority of the money will be going. Also, I need to pay for the trip itself. This will cover all of my meals, airport transportation, my housing, and my 24/7 service with the oraginization. I will be leaving on December 17th for one week. Any amount that you give will be greatly appreciated! Thank you so much!¬† ",

            "description": " WARNING GRAPHIC IMAGES   Rosie a beautiful loyal Poodle mix was hit by a car and was dragged 5-7 feet- her family witnessed everything that was happening to Rosie. She suffered serious injuries such as having her right arm ripped open to the bone from underarm to wrist, severe contusions to her neck and back; the impact caused Rosie's ear to be torn off which exposed the cartilage. Her family immediately picked her up and sought help, they took her to a place where they thought would help her; they took her to the Downey Shelter believing that the shelter would help keep Rosie alive. That was the furthest from reality. Luckily, for the family Lisa Corona saw the family and asked if Rosie was sick, once Lisa saw Rosie she knew that Rosie needed help-the shelter was not going to help Rosie but kill her once they convinced the family to surrender her.   Rosie is now at Dr. Werber's office receiving the care she needs to recover from her injuries, she had surgery on Wednesday to re-attach her ear to her skull   she is having surgery again today to do a \"debridement\" on her right leg to completely clean the bone area   scrape off the necrotic skin   tissue from her ligaments. Rosie is going to need long term bandage changes while her right arm is allowed to grow new skin (think of very bad burns on a human)   they will continue the cleaning process to scrape the dead tissue every few days for a few months until she is completely healed.  Please donate any amount you can, funds will be directly given to Dr. Werber for saving Rosie's life.  Thank you for your generosity and love for Rosie and her family.     ",

            "description": "  Erik, at 13 yrs. the oldest of 3 children was diagnosed with Steven Johnsons Syndrome/TEN in February 8, 2013 (Originally misdiagnosed on 2/5/13) He had a severe allergic reaction to Azithromycin or Ibuprofen (there is no test to administer to verify which medication it was). He was hospitalized for 1 month - in which he spent 3 weeks in the ICU. Erik was Treated as a burn victim and had several eye procedures done while in the ICU. He lost 70% of his skin. He has currently been diagnosed with the \"vanishing bile duct syndrome\". This is a very rare condition... none of the doctors we have seen have seen this in any patient before. So, he will be placed on the transplant list in hopes of a new liver. Aside from his liver, he developed scars in his eye lids. Which will require more surgeries.  Knowing that there is NO chance of a full recovery our hopes are that we can help him with any current and future medical needs.  So, please if you are able to donate anything - It would mean so much to him/us. If you can't we understand. However, We would ask that you please say a prayer for him and share this page...   THANK YOU so much for taking the time to read this. Thank you for any donations and specially for ALL YOUR PRAYERS!! GOD BLESS YOU ALL!!   *********   Erik, a los 13 a√±os.

El fue hospitalizado por un per√≠odo de 1 mes - en el que, durante 3 semanas fueron en la UCI. Erik fue tratado como una v√≠ctima de quemadura y tuvo varios procedimientos en los ojos durante este tiempo. Perdi√≥ 70% de su piel. Actualmente ha sido diagnosticado con \"s√≠ndrome de las v√≠as biliares\".  Esta es una afecci√≥n muy rara... ninguno de los m√©dicos que hemos consultado han visto esto. Por lo tanto, estar√° en la lista de trasplante con la esperanza de un nuevo h√≠gado. \r\nAparte de su h√≠gado, Erik, desarroll√≥ unas cicatrices en sus p√°rpados. Lo que requerir√° m√°s cirug√≠as. \r\nSabiendo que no hay posibilidad de una recuperaci√≥n completa. Nuestra esperanza es de que lo podamos ayudar con sus actuales y futuras necesidades m√©dicas. \r\n \r\nPor lo tanto, por favor, si usted es capaz de donar hoy, significar√≠a mucho para √©l.

He has started his first of 6-8 rounds of aggressive chemotherapy, and unfortunately the bills are starting to pile up.  We were not prepared and are still waiting for his LTD to be processed.  In the meantime, we are expected to pay not only the household bills, but are hit with having to pay his insurance and medical expenses in order to continue treatment.  We have reduced the bills, including giving up my car (loan and insurance costs) but the medical costs are coming in.  The goal above covers his out of pocket expenses so far, insurance costs, and what we anticipate still to come from surgeon and hospital.  We know everyone has their own problems, but if you can help with a few dollars, we would greatly appreciate anything to help this battle, and allow Reggie to focus solely on his recovery, and not the stress of finances.  Reggie is a proud man, and hates to ask for anything from anyone, so I took it upon myself to create this page and ask for help.  We appreciate all the amazing support from everyone, keep those prayers coming. ",

Octavio murio tratando de salvar a su dama. Me duele el corazon solo de pensar que estuvo solo en su partida. En nuestras √∫ltimas conversaciones hace una semana me dec√≠a lo mucho que la extra√±aba y necesitaba a su lado. Les pido a ustedes ahora m√°s que nunca su apoyo. No dejemos sola a Rosalba. D√©mosle a Octavio la tranquilidad de que sus amigos estamos aqui. Por favor de aportar algo y compartir este post. Se que son momentos dif√≠ciles para todos, pero lo poco o mucho que puedan dar sumar√° si todos nos unimos. De esta forma Rosalba podr√° solventar los gastos que esta situaci√≥n le causar√°n y recibir el tratamiento necesario para combatir la terrible enfermedad que sufre. Aqui el link de gofundme  http://www.gofundme.com/ayudemosOctavio   Por favor hagan los dep√≥sitos aqu√≠ con sus tarjetas de cr√©dito o d√©bito no importa si son Mexicanas o de USA u otro pa√≠s.  Octavio no quer√≠a usar una cuenta de M√©xico ya que le estaban quitando impuestos . Gracias por su apoyo. Lo que sea que puedan era de mucha ayuda. $50, $100 pesos o dolares! todo unido se suma. Y favor de postear este link para que m√°s personas se enteren. Gracias!  Este es el texto que Octavio nos dejo buscando ayuda de todos nosotros antes de su partida.  Queridos amigos, - por Octavio Hernandez¬†  En las buenas y en las malas se le mide el pulso a la ciudad y a los amigos. En las buenas se se celebran los logros y se comparten como con El Arca de Ne√≥n (radio), Duelo deRebeldes (concurso), La Frontera Aqu√≠ (festival), el TijuaNeo (impreso y digital), etc. Con los que apoyamos con pasi√≥n y profesionalismo la cultura, la m√∫sica y el arte tanto local, como nacional y californiana.¬†En las malas, se busca el apoyo y la solidaridad de los amigos y aliados en la eterna batalla de la vida. Hago p√∫blica la¬†noticia de que en diciembre de 2013, le comenz√≥ una extra√±a enfermedad a mi dama, pareja, socia y compa√±era de la vida Rosalba Velasco. Con dolores en las piernas y p√©rdida del equilibrio,mes tras mes fue empeorando hasta terminar lamentablemente en silla de ruedas. Es un trastorno neuorol√≥gico motriz, que si tiene cura, pero en Tijuana tras consultar a muchos m√©dicos de varias especialidades, no tuvimos suerte, gastamos un dineral y nadie la pudo curar.¬†Hace algunos meses la enfermedad nos super√≥ y se fue con su familia a La Paz para consultar un especialista que le recomendaron y est√° en espera de que consigamos los recursos para poder llevarla con m√©dicos alternativos en el DF y Monterrey,ciudades que tienen cl√≠nicas en las que puede recuperarse, siguiendo el consejo de un m√©dico amigo. Por tal raz√≥n iniciamos hoy una campa√±a para obtener apoyos, en base a donaciones de la cantidad que les sea posible por este medio de GO FUND ME. E igual realizaremos algunos eventos a beneficio en Tijuana, a los cuales les invitaremos en fecha pr√≥xima para que nos acompa√±en. Agradecemos a los amigos m√∫sicos que nos apoyar√°n e igual estamos abiertos a recibir propuestas de otros artistas, actores, bailarines o artistas pl√°sticos, etc, que quieran apoyarnos en este dif√≠cil momento.¬†Hemos sido fuertes ante este enorme reto, porque sabemos que saldremos adelante con la ayuda de Dios, los santos y los √°ngeles, y de los que nos quieren y estiman, y aprecian todo lo que hemos hecho por esta hermosa ciudad a la que amamos y por el tr√°nsito de la cultura de Los Angeles a la frontera. Ahora nuestra prioridad es que mi √°ngel en desgracia se cure y vuelva a sonre√≠rcomo antes.  ¬†  Mil gracias a todos. \r\n OCTAVIO HERNANDEZ DIAZ¬† \r\n 1959 - 2015¬† \r\n D.E.P (R.I.P) ",

It has really become an eye opening experience which has allowed me to meet many loving and caring people of the Muay Thai community. I currently fight and train out of Sitan Gym in Queens New York under one of the best trainers in the world, Aziz Nabih.  ¬†How I got started : About four years ago I was on my way to Sign up to Planet Fitness. After having gained the Freshman 15 in college I received a call from Local Union Number 3. I decided to get myself in order to keep up with the construction lifestyle and chaos. On my way to sign up I bumped into my cousin Joel Estevez, who I cannot thank enough for introducing me to the sport, who encouraged me to go to the gym with him. And it is honestly one of the best decisions I have ever made.¬†  Purpose for Gofundme:¬† I competed In an amateur Muay Thai tournament this past March and have now qualified to represent Team USA in the Worlds Muay Thai tournament. The tournament will take place in Spain this November. Since I am still an amateur fighter I must come up with the funds for the trip myself.   How can you help:  I am asking for a small donation from people in order to help pay for my trip to Spain to compete in this tournament. There is no minimum and any dollar donated is greatly appreciated and a huge help. I promise that I will do my best and make everyone proud.   Thank you.",

This couldn't have came at a worse time. We recently had our son at the end of September. With myself on maternity leave, and only being able to only work weekends when I go back to the clinic, this bill has really put us in a corner. I am not one to ask anyone for help like this, and I'm not sure how I even feel about it now, but I love my dog. I would do anything to make her better. It just breaks my heart to see her in this much pain. We got a potty patch so she can go to the bathroom on the deck, and avoid the stairs. Josh is going to build a ramp for her as well, but these are only temporary relief. Anything would help at this point to relieve some of this stress. I just want her to feel better and be able to live her entire life span without pain.",

            "description": "Hello Everyone,   As some of you may already know, My brother Marco was in a very serious Motorcycle accident Sunday, October 12th 2014. If you didn't know. I'm sure you can understand the horror we felt when we were notified. We did not have time to think. Just react. The shock is still sinking in.   Marco suffered multiple fractured vertebrae, 7 broken ribs, and a collapsed lung. The doctors had to perform a¬†craniotomy to alleviate the hemorrhaging in his brain from the impact. His lungs and liver shifted in the crash and suffered internal bleeding from these injuries. He was in an induced coma for 5 days.    First and foremost, my apologies if I did not personally inform you and you heard it through the grapevine. If you know my brother, you know he is very private. And when it comes to family matters so am I. I had to ask Sonia, his beautiful wife, if I could open this account. They don't want to ask for money. But I have been here with them from the beginning and I can already see the struggles ahead. Everyone wants to know how they can help, and Prayers are the most important. But they have a family, and he is still in very critical condition. He has a long road ahead of him for recovery. The trips across the bridge and parking fees add up quickly.¬† And these will be necessary as outpatient rehab is in store. He won't be able to work for a while, and Sonia as well. And you know as well as I do that the bills don't stop when life might feel like it has come to a screeching halt.    I humbly ask if you truly want to help, please donate what you can. I created this account for anyone who wants to help but doesn't know how. It is always awkward to ask for things. I am not shy in asking for what I know will benefit my big brother and his beautiful family. My niece and nephew are their world. I'm sure many of you know this. My brother is a hard workingman, he works his fingers to the bone to provide for his family, as I'm sure you all do for your family. And right now, this will not be possible until he fully recovers.   I thank you all for your time and your thoughts and prayers. I hope you know how much this will help and anything is appreciated.    Always with Love,   Adrie, on behalf of Marco, Sonia, Javier and Alexsandra Corona",

Firstline Systems and a few other companies have been passing the hat around at certain jobsites in the Seattle area. ¬†All trades have contributed what they can. ¬†With Luis beginning chemotherapy this week, bills will start adding up quickly. ¬†Our hope is to try to make this journey as comfortable as possible for the Corona family.

Unfortunately, the school directors are retiring and our beloved Woodroe Woods School will be closing in June of 2016.   There has been an overwhelmingly positive response from the teachers and parents of Woodroe Woods, who are collaborating to open a new school. There is a profound need for quality early childhood education and childcare ‚Äì for the children, for the parents, for the community. This is one profession where dedication and experience are crucial.   We need your help!  While we are working to find a new location, there is an immediate need to raise funds to help with covering the significant expenses of starting up a new school. The funds we raise will go towards the purchase of the following items:  - Portable Classrooms - Architectural Lot Improvements - Moving Expenses - Permits - Licensing - Legal Fees - Playground Equipment (Climbing Structures, Swings, Slides, Sandbox, etc.) - Indoor Furniture (Tables, Chairs, Cubbies, Bookcases, Toy Storage Bins, etc.) - Art Supplies - Appliances (Washer, Dryer, Vacuum Cleaner, Telephone System, Fans, etc.) - Cleaning Supplies (Brooms, Dustpans, Mops, Detergent, etc.) - Office Supplies (Paper, Ink, Staplers, etc.) - Office Equipment (Computer, Copier, Printer/Fax, Filing Cabinets, Desks, etc.)  With roughly 160 Preschool through 2nd grade students attending Woodroe Woods each academic calendar year (and many families on the waiting list), the impact of this school closure on this community is great. Additionally, our fun and educational summer camp enrolls an additional 50 students through 4th grade each year. Without this program, many families will be scrambling to find quality childcare for the summer.  The children, parents and teachers of Woodroe Woods will be so grateful for your support. With your help, we are confident we can make this dream a reality. We look forward to serving this community for decades to come.  We will be posting progress updates on our¬†Facebook page periodically. Please visit the   Woodroe's New Beginning Facebook page ¬†  for updates .  Don't forget to¬†like and share our updates to help us spread the word!¬†Together, we can make it happen.                                                ",

            "description": " This is Yassmeen Castanada's story ... ..  On Thanksgiving ¬†Yaasmeen was feeling ill. Common cold, sore¬†¬†throat. A ¬†friend offered her an antibiotic pill that her friend had from a previous illness. She was thinking that it would help her, but this would be the biggest mistake of her life. ¬†After taking the pill , Yaasmeen started experiencing burning in her throat, eyes and mouth. As the night went by, her eyes became blood shot red and the lining of her lips was already ¬†torn off. ¬†I rushed her to the ER . The dr's immediately diagnosed her with Stevens-Johnson Syndrome. ¬†Something ¬†I've never heard about. ¬†Immediately I googled Stevens Johnson's ¬†and I began to panic. In ¬†my mind I knew this couldn't happen to my baby, but deep down in the pit of my stomach was a terrible, terrible feeling. Within 4 days ¬†Yaasmeen's appearance was transformed. I ¬†watched my daughter's skin burn, blister, bubble, n peel off and there was nothing I could do about it. ¬†The pain and agony she was going through just tore my heart to pieces. She was transferred to UCIrvine's ¬†burn unit. On December 5th she has surgery to scrape the top portion of her body. She was wrapped in biobrane. 2days later the bottom portion of her body was scraped. As you can see in the photo, she was wrapped in bandages from hed to toe. My daughter was intubated so she couldn't communicate with me. i made sure i prayed over her daily, I spoke to her daily and reminded her that she had a daughter that loved her very much. Everyday i told her to fight for her life. Yaasmeens blood was infected and she has had 5 blood trasfusions. As we got closer to recovery, she had a set back. She was having a hard time breathing. After multiple exams of her trachea, they noticed her airway was closing so she had an emergency tracheotomy. she had her trach for 6months. There have been times where she ¬†had trouble ¬†breathing. She had another surgery in april to open her airway because it closed and the steriod injections didn't work. On my birthday June 18th she had surgery to reconstruct her trachea. She was able to sing happy birthday to me as soon as the anesthesia wore off. Best gift ever! Today 6/25 Yaasmeen had her stitches removed. Yay! ¬†Her left eye is very damaged, she will need a cornea transplant. Hopefully in 6-8 months when she is healthier we can face that surgery. As for now, she will just work on getting healthier and spending a lot of time with her daughter Khloe and return to CSULA! This whole expierence has taught me to never take my children for granted. I almost lost my daughter to 1 pill! She never smoke or drank, she is a good kid that was on the right path. I just can't understand why this happened the way it did. But we will not dwell in the past, She has goals and a ¬†bright future ¬†ahead of her. I thank all of you for your love, support and prayers for my daughter. *Please be careful with medications because an allergic reaction can happen to anyone. #prayforyaas",

            "description": "Hello Friends and Family,   The Corona- Velazquez Family has made this GoFund me page to help with medical expenses for Eduardo (Pix) and his family. Many of you might not know but throughout the years Pix has been slowly losing his vision. At first we all thought that his vision was getting worse because of the time and his age, but during the last doctor‚Äôs visit in November 2015 we knew something wasn‚Äôt right. The Optometrist we saw said that he could have glaucoma and he sent us to see an Ophthalmologist. We found many of them but none in our network of insurance. At one point Pix was ready to give up and just live with the fact that he would be losing his vision little by little. I finally convinced him in getting it checked out. We found an ophthalmologist in town that would take him ASAP. The Ophthalmologist said we would have to pay for the visit in full and not including any extra test , if required.The first thing we thought was ‚ÄúHow are we going to pay this?‚Äù $300+ just for the visit and plus the extra test.    After a few test, the Ophthalmologist recommended we get Pix an MRI done due to the test results. He has lost complete vision of his right eye and half of his left. At the time I thought, ‚ÄúHow can he live like this?‚Äù We were scared but determined to get him the help that he needs. Now we had to find a radiology office that was ‚Äúin network‚Äù once again no luck. 1k out of pocket for the MRI. They told us we could see the results during our next doctor's appointment. It wasn‚Äôt long before his doctor called us a couple hours saying we needed to come to his office immediately. So many thoughts were rushing through our minds, what could it be? All this time we thought it was Glaucoma and that he just needed a better prescription for his glasses. We were completely blind sided.   We were then told that Pix has a Pituitary Adenoma tumor that is located in the top center of his brain and it is pressing against his optic nerve which is causing him to lose his vision. We were sent to Stanford to meet with a Neurosurgeon, but were later denied because of our insurance. We then were sent to another Neurosurgeon in Monterey. We weren‚Äôt seen there because they said it was too large for him to perform the surgery. After being bounced back and forth to different doctors, lost wages due to appointments , paid hundreds of dollars to be seen by them, we were finally sent to UCSF. Rated top 4 in the country. With that title we were sure that a huge price tag came with it. Our insurance was in network, but wasn‚Äôt able to pay it all.    Now on June 7, 2016, Pix will finally have his surgery!! The downside to it all is, we have spent a lot of money in just getting to where we are now. We are struggling to pay for his surgery. The surgery will take place in UCSF and will require pre and several post-op visits. Out of pocket costs, which include the amount not covered by insurance as well as travel expenses, will run approximately $10,000. We have hit a roadblock and we need your help. We are glad that the doctors were able to find the tumor before it grew any larger. The tumor is the size of a tomato now and at any given moment it can damage the optic nerve enough that he can go blind and stay like that for the rest of his life. This surgery is very important because Pix has two small children who he wishes to see every single day while they grow up. It would be devastating to not be able to pay for this very important surgery. Any little counts, all will be greatly appreciated!   Thank you from the Corona- Velazquez Family!",

            "description": "Thank you for visiting Cristina‚Äôs gofundme page! Cristina was diagnosed with scoliosis in the fall of 2014.   This page was set up to help support Cristina‚Äôs scoliosis treatment. Cristina will begin her treatment journey by having Vertebroplasty (back surgery) during the winter break of 2015.¬† At which point 10 of Cristina‚Äôs vertebrae will be fused by doctors from Shriners Hospital of Los Angeles CA.   ¬†Cristina‚Äôs family was recently told that she has a very aggressive form of scoliosis. The conventional scoliosis treatment of bracing and physical therapy are not a treatment option for her because of the aggressive nature of her condition.  In the past 6 months her curvature has gone from less than 43 degrees to 58 degrees and is expected to progress at a rate of 2 degrees per month. With the onset of adolescent growth, the curve and rotation of her vertebrae will continue to worsen.¬†Our only treatment option is spinal fusion surgery. However, because she is only 11, traditional fusion with titanium rods and bone grafting are not the treatment option that will have the most beneficial outcome for Cristina. Traditional fusion will limit her range of motion and not allow her to grow normally.   Cristina is full of life, an amazing daughter, an¬†excellent student, energetic, artistic, vibrant, and a lover of Arts. Cristina has been a dedicated Folkorico dancer since the age of 7.¬† The emotional strain that she will feel of not being part of her dance troop will most definitely be more than the physical pain for her.    The road to recovery will not be an easy one physically, emotionally, and financially. Her parents have taken time off of their jobs to be close to their daughter, but as we all know, the bills of everyday living do not stop.There will also be upcoming medical expenses that will need to be covered, and a long list of pre-surgery purchases that are needed¬† such as an orthopedic bed, art supplies, dog emotional support training and license (her dog is her best friend), alternative rehabilitation classes (Meditational training), financial burden of missing work ¬†and the list goes on and on.        Please, I ask all of my family, friends, friends of family, etc., to please help us help Cristina and her family in this hour of need. Cristina is a fighter and she will overcome this!  We are kindly asking you to help support us in this endeavor. Any contribution you wish to make towards Cristina's surgery and recovery would be greatly appreciated.¬†If you are not able to make any contribution by all means  Please share share share this page . If we get 1000 shares and 1000 people donate $1 then Cristina will have $1000. I am setting the goal high because just the expense of the bed is scary.   ¬†We thank you in advance for your generosity, compassion and prayers for this little Warrior.   ¬†Blessing to you today, tomorrow and always.

            "description": " Dearly beloved!  The Lord has invited me to become an applicant member of the  Madonna House  Apostolate on September 8th of this Holy Year of Mercy!  I¬†spent last year living there as a guest. I¬†lived their life; serving, working, praying, and taking classes in their Fall and Spring Programs.¬†At the end of my time there, Jesus' invitation in my heart to come back and stay became clear: to find Him, love Him, and serve Him wholeheartedly in this community, one day at a time through Mary by His Grace. There's many amazing things about the community, and so many difficulties and things I would never choose, but this yes is to His voice and invitation alone.¬†May His mercy continue to pour and lead!    I'm entering as an applicant... Applicancy is two years of¬†formation, after which, God willing, promises are made: \"For the glory of God and because I desire with my whole heart to respond to the call of Jesus Christ\"... to live in¬†poverty, chastity, and obedience \"according to the spirit and mandate of Madonna House.\"¬†    Their spirit, in a word, is¬† Nazareth; ¬†to live, love, work and serve, as the¬†Holy Family in Nazareth in all aspects of life. This is also to live, with the Lord's Grace, His command to love; particularly serving and being one with the poor. The community is often called \"The People of the Towel and the Water\".    Living the Gospel and restoring the world to Christ is expressed at Madonna House in a variety of ways, as is Love's¬†endless creativity: - serving one another in all ordinary matters of life, doing little things \"exceedingly well for love of Christ\" - spiritual formation programs for young people, families, and men discerning the priesthood - service to the local community, especially to the poor - evangelization through publications (newspaper, books, music, etc), talks, retreats, listening, spiritual direction, art, music, etc., -¬†providing a divine milieu to guests who come year round (like me!) -currently,¬†18 mission houses through Canada, the U.S., Belgium, Cariacou, Britain, and Russia, each with their particular mission expressed by the heart of the Madonna House spirit. - restoring the earth through Christ through what the foundress called \"apostolic farming\" - \"Love, love, love, never counting the cost\"....¬†  Convinced that this call is not only for me but for the entire Body of Christ, I invite you to support me :).  I beg for your prayers for me and for my family during this time!¬†Our joined prayers in His Name will continue to unite us as a Body and will bring forth abundant graces.¬† All Glory be to God !   If you are also able to support in some financial way it'd be an enormous blessing; whatever is in your heart and are able.¬†I know there's many needs at this time, certainly for you, personally, and for our Christian and non-Christian family, so I do not ask unaware of that. I ask being unable to get there save by God's Providence, in whom my trust rests and in whom I place you as well. To get there I need to take care of some medical, immigration, and travel expenses (I'm a Mexican citizen and currently¬†living in Mexico), and some cover for the winter¬†(Combermere is quite cold :O). If some of it winds up not being used by me, I will make sure it goes to the poor.¬†   Thank you for reading me and your support! I place all in Christ's and Our Lady of Combermere's hands! ¬† If you have any questions please contact me at sofia289@gmail.com!

On Sunday July 14, 2016 Julianna Corona developed a severe headache and nausea that landed her in the hospital. The doctors performed a MRI scan which proved to be abnormal. The doctors told Julianna and her family that she had 2-3 brain tumors. On Monday, July 15th, Julianna had her first brain surgery in which they biopsied her tumors and removed one. On Thursday, July 18th, Julianna was officially diagnosed with the most common and most aggressive brain cancer called Glioblastoma Multiforme (GMB). The doctors have discovered 7 cancerous tumors on the left side of her brain. GMB is a grade IV cancer that is not curable and is terminal. Julianna needs aggressive treatments of Radiation Therapy and Chemotherapy to prolong her life. The Corona family is completely devastated.    Julianna Corona is a young beautiful mother, wife, daughter, and sister. Julianna is a 28 year old stay at home mother of three beautiful girls aged 9, 5, and 2. Up until Sunday, Julianna was still breast feeding her youngest daughter. Julianna is married to Pedro Corona, a hardworking and well-loved, DonJon Marine employee in the C   M Metals Recycling division in Dover, NJ. Julianna and her family need our help. Her loving husband Pedro is the sole provider for her and their 3 children. Pedro has been unable to go to work since her diagnosis because he has been by her side in the hospital while also caring for their three beautiful girls. Julianna needs to start treatment immediately to prolong her survival. She will be having Radiation Therapy daily on her brain, in addition to daily Chemotherapy. Due to complications with medical coverage, none of¬† her Chemotherapy medications as well as future treatments are covered at this time. Julianna and Pedro are in desperate need of our financial support. Julianna has so much to live for. She loves her husband and three children so much and all she wants in life is to watch them grow and be there for them. Julianna desperately needs to start the Chemotherapy medication in order to prolong her life as long as possible.   There comes a time in everyone's life where help is needed and the Corona's urgently need ours. Please donate to this beautiful family that needs our help. By helping get Julianna the proper medication and alleviating financial burdens would mean the world to the Corona family. No one knows how much time Julianna has left but helping this family financially for medical costs and inability to work at the present time would ease a huge burden for them so they can enjoy what time they have left. Thank you all for your donations and considering helping the Corona family. God bless.  Thank you from family and friends.       ",

Doug and Kristy Andrews have been running ASV for some time now and are finding it difficult to keep up with the center's financial obligations. For the past two years Kristy has been in remission from breast cancer, but recently discovered the cancer has returned, is now stage four, and has metastasized.  Currently, Raghu Clark and the rest of the ASV team are continuing to magnetize the center and they may need a couple more years to hit a break-even point in their finances.  ASV needs to supplement the monthly rent of $5,000 for the temple and boutique. The money raised will be used to help maintain ASV. It will allow Doug to focus on and be with Kristy in this trying time of her life.  Let's all unite in Divine Mother's love to help our dear friends in their time of need. If you are able, please donate towards our goal of $30,000. The money will go to making ASV stable, so it may continue to be a beacon of Master's teaching in Santa Cruz County.  With God's love and strength we can achieve this!  In Master's love,  A master devotee",

She is a daughter, mother, wife, grandma and will fight this battle with God on her side!   Because pancreatic cancer is the deadliest of cancers, there was an urgency for treatment. The doctors weren't concerned about it too much and have not tried their best to help her. There was no other choice, but, to look for better options. Her kids searched for hours and hours at a time, and came across a better solution. The clinic that we have been led to is American Holistic in Mexico. The clinic features more highly effective treatment options under one roof than any other cancer clinic, and it has done well in treating pancreatic cancer patients. This is an expensive program, though, and is not covered by insurance. The treatment costs range from $45,000 to $50,000.   Debbie has finished treatment but, in the meantime the medical bills(including treatment) are piling high. There has been so much support from family and friends to make the trips to and from Mexico, the accommodations, and meals. All of this support is so much appreciated and we love you all for reaching out and helping Debbie and the family in this time of need. What we are asking is that you donate any amount that you feel in your heart(it doesn't matter how little) and please spread the word and share this page.   We refuse to let this disease tear us down. We are in good spirits and we continue to rely on God, as the joy of the Lord is our strength and the strength of the Lord is our joy.   Our family has set a goal to raise $50,000, and all funds donated would go specifically to the costs of her medical expenses (plus the fees charged by GoFundMe).   Throughout this journey, we have been blessed with so many people giving us prayer and love. Several have asked what they can do to help. Contributing to the cost of Debbie's treatments would be a blessing. We would be so grateful for your donations.   We have strong faith to believe that God will move people to help us, and we do believe He will completely heal Debbie in Jesus' Name!   As a mother, wife, grandmother, Debbie still has so much more to experience with her family. Thank you so much to all of those who would like to help. God bless you abundantly for your generosity. Your loving gift will be received with great appreciation!   Please continue to keep Debbie in your prayers, as she fights this disease for her family, friends and other survivors of pancreatic cancer.   Our family thanks you for your support.

He often said that they were the strength and the engine that kept him going through it all.  ¬†  Elias was and will continue to be a very loved and respected member of our community.¬† Elias earned the respect and admiration of all his students, parents and colleagues from the moment that he started working in our district.¬† Elias absolutely loved his students and the families that he got to know through his work.¬† Whenever he saw a need, he took proactive measures to help.¬† It was not rare to see him come to work sometimes, carrying boxes and bags with shoes and clothes for students who desperately needed them.¬† For many years, he also provided school supplies for many of his students.¬† Some of his colleagues even witnessed hip reaching into his pocket and put all the cash he could spare into the hand of someone in need.  ¬†  As a colleague, he was always willing to help. He often went the extra mile to help those who could use a hand.¬† His trademark was excellence, respect and hard work. Elias was, without a doubt, a teacher who loved his profession, and more importantly, he loved his students and their families deeply.¬†¬† Elias dedicated much of his life and talents to become one of the best educators in the field.  ¬†  To many of us, he quickly became a dear friend. Elias was definitely, the kind of friend that everyone would love to have.¬† Elias was also an amazing husband and father.¬† Elias never missed an opportunity to share the great love and support he received from his wife and his daughter.¬† He was a man who honored his family and was not shy showing his love and appreciation for them.  ¬†  Due to his intense fight against the devastating illness that finally took him, Elias‚Äô savings and earnings took a devastating hit as well. However, giving up was never an option to them.¬† The whole family has worked together tirelessly, not only to fight Cancer, but to overcome their recent financial limitations.¬† Unfortunately, even after all their hard work and conscientious efforts, their resources are insufficient to face their current situation.¬† Medical bills and funerary costs have and will continue to add to their challenging circumstances for a while.  ¬†  At this time, we are asking those who have been inspired in any way by Elias‚Äô life and example to join our efforts to help his wife, ¬†Maria Alina Corona with the many expenses that she now has to face alone on top of the unimaginable grief and sorrow of losing her best friend and companion.¬† Whatever contribution you are able to make will be personally received and managed by Maria Alina Corona.  We pray that the life of such a dedicated teacher and friend can touch your heart and, at least on the economic area, you will be willing to help to this cause and make their sorrows a little lighter for this family.  ¬†  Thank you for your help, love and support to this beautiful family, you will be blessed for your efforts.  ¬†  Thank you!!",

Despite this, her life was unexpectedly taken away while she vacationed in Mexico. She never got to wake up to kiss her daughter, Viviana in the morning or to comfort her oldest son Adrian, who was waiting for her return.  Words just simply cannot express how much pain this immense loss has inflicted on our entire family, especially for her children. We are asking for your prayers during this difficult time including any support to cover her funeral costs and expenses. Any amount will be genuinely appreciated as it would greatly help to lessen the financial burden and give her the proper honor and memorial that my sister deserves.  Please feel free to share this to let others know. God bless. Isaiah 33:2 Lord, be gracious to us, we long for you. Be our strength every morning, our salvation in time of distress. //  El 3 de enero del 2017, mi hermana Fabiola Rodr√≠guez, nunca regres√≥ a casa.

Ella nunca lleg√≥ a despertar en la ma√±ana¬†para besar a su hija, Viviana ¬†o para consolar a su hijo mayor Adrian, que estaba esperando su regreso.  Las palabras simplemente no pueden expresar cu√°nto dolor ha causado la inmensa p√©rdida a toda nuestra familia, especialmente a sus hijos. Estamos pidiendo sus oraciones durante este tiempo dif√≠cil, incluyendo cualquier apoyo para cubrir sus gastos y gastos de funeral. Cualquier cantidad ser√° genuinamente apreciada, ya que ser√≠a de gran ayuda para disminuir los gastos financieros y darle el honor y el recuerdo que mi hermana merece.

            "description": "Everyone has a dream, THAT THING they've always wanted to do if all the right doors would open. Twenty years ago I sat in a British Literature class at CWU and found my dream. I wanted to study in¬†London. It was always a \"pie in the sky/wouldn't it be cool if\" sort of dream. My practical side kept going to school, built a full-time teaching career and established a pretty rewarding life. I am a \"professional student.\" Which probably explains why I am also a teacher. Meanwhile, that¬†dream always floated out there--waiting. ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†Until last spring. The dream sat down in my lap and took up residence when I was least expecting it. Through a series of open doors, and gentle shoves from God, I applied for a Fulbright Scholarship to attend an innovative interdisciplinary program at  Royal Holloway , University of London. To complete my scholarship application I had to also apply to the school itself for admittance. Deep in my heart I knew, that I knew, that I knew God had led me to this opportunity, and ¬†I could not ignore it. ¬† ¬† ¬†Now I face a¬†conundrum. I have been accepted to Royal Holloway to begin my  program  in September 2017. However, I learned at the end of January that I did not receive the Fulbright Scholarship, which¬†would have covered a¬†large bulk of the cost for me move to, attend school, live in and then return from the UK. ¬†My conservative estimate is that I need at least $50,000 USD to fund everything for a year.¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Asking for money in this fashion is WAY outside my comfort zone. In the past I worked my way through school. Slowy but surely everything has always been paid off. ¬†However, that isn't an option this time around. I need the bulk of the money up front and the rest to live on for the year since if I can work it would be only on a limited part time basis. I'm applying for other smaller scholarships but even together they would only cover a small fraction of the cost -if I win them. A¬†friend recently encouraged¬†me that I only \"need 5,000 people to give $10.\" ¬†I don't know 5,000 people. But the \"six degrees of separation\" adage is totally true. So even though I don't know enough people, all my friends do! If¬†God has truly called me to this opportunity then He will fund it - I'm just trying to make all the options available to Him! Every prayer, share and dollar given brings me one step closer to a dream fulfilled.",

Going undiagnosed, Brandon was sent home where his condition continued to worsen. After having a couple episodes of passing out his family brought him home to South Florida for additional testing.  Doctors were able to discover a serious brain condition that required immediate surgery. Following the surgery, he was sent home to recover where his symptoms returned‚Ä¶ this time worse. Rushing back to the doctor‚Äôs office, it was discovered that the previous surgery was not successful and another procedure was needed. After the second emergent brain surgery, doctors found the pressure on his brain needed to be better controlled. Brandon is scheduled today (March 2, 2017) to undergo a third brain surgery to remove a portion of his skull to relieve the pressure pushing on his brain.  The Corona family has been a pillar in the community. Hector Corona, Brandon‚Äôs father, is a Battalion Chief with the Margate-Coconut Creek Fire Department. He has been a member of the fire department for 29 years and has dedicated his life to helping others in their time of need. Brandon‚Äôs mother, Julie Corona, has been a registered nurse for over 30 years. She has worked in emergency medicine, home healthcare, and hospice care. Both of his parents have given support to many families throughout the community by hosting fundraiser event and giving their time volunteering.  During this tough time for Brandon, Julie has taken time off work to care for him and be by his side. On his time off, Hector is an instructor at the fire academy and has stepped away to care for his son as well. Medical bills and loss of work has put a significant financial strain on this amazing family.",

My sweet, selfless, profoundly wise father is 52 years old and has been healthy his whole life. He recently completed his PHD in leadership and was scheduled for graduation June 16, 2017. Unfortunately he will not walk during a much anticipated graduation and instead will be confined to a hospital bed for post surgery recovery. During a routine checkup he was told he had artetial plaque in 6 different locations and would immediately require an extensive quadruple bypass. As you can imagine this was heartbreaking news for someone who is active and has never had any major medical issues. After the surgery he will be out of work for several weeks which will cause a heavy financial burden on him and his family. After insurance pays their part he is still left with a bill of $75,000. This is going to cost a lot of money, time, patience, people and God‚Äôs hands with the surgeons. So all we are asking is for a little help to lift the burden off his shoulders so he can just focus on getting better. The funds would be used to offset the costs of bills. Every dollar counts and we just ask that you give as God has given us. In the event that you cannot donate prayers are free and are always needed. Thank you and God bless.  ‚óÑ 2 Corinthians 9:7 ‚ñ∫ \"Each of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.\"   ",

            "description": "\r\n Hi my name is Emmanuel Corona I was born January 4, 2011 with only half a heart and problems with my lung. When My Mommy was pregnant Doctors told my parents I had a low chance of living...My first eight months of life I spent them at UCSF Children's Hospital. After only three weeks of being home I had to be rushed back because I caught meningitis. I was in the intensive care unit for months. In my six years of life I went to the hospital many times because of my conditions, but in so short time I also got to enjoy the beautiful things of life like family, friends, my doctors and nurses and the joy of being a kid. For example, the time I visited Disney World in Orlando thanks to the Make-A-Wish foundation!! In October 2016 that's when things got complicated... I was sent to UCLA for advanced studies and to see if I would qualify for a heart transplant.. After four days of studies I did not qualify... my parents were also told that the doctors we were running out of options. I got the opportunity to get sent home to celebrate my last Christmas, my last New year ...my last birthday. Months after I turned SIX I went back to UCSF for a surgery that would either save my life or take my life..., I made it... but even then my family never lost hope and prayed for a huge Miracle, along with prayers from people Sent from all around the world. My last battle was hard and I fought hard, but God had other plans for me and decided my mission here was done. On July 25, 2017 at about 5:30 AM Jesus came for me and took me to a place, where there is no pain no suffering a place where I could watch over my loved ones. He took me to heaven. I ask you to help my family with My expenses.. Anything would help!! A BIG Thank you to those who stood by my side\r\n \r\n",

She was the hardest working person we knew, day in day out battling this cruel disease, she mustered up the courage and very little energy she had to go to work always with a smile on her face, all for her children. She fought cancer with all of her strength, it took everything from her but she never stopped striving for a better future for us. She touched many lives in positive ways, always lending out a helping hand and never expecting anything in return. She was loved by many and will forever be remembered as a generous beautiful woman that always put everyone before her. We know she is in a better place with no more agony and pain, resting in peace and that eases our hearts. Mom, we will miss your sense of humor and that never give up attitude that characterized you. You were our rock, our everything, but we will try our best to emulate your strength as you would want us to. Siempre estaras en nuestro corazon, please visit us in our dreams, Mami te queremos de aqui al cielo. - With love Candy, Diana   Dorian.    This gofundme page has been created to honor her presence.

What happened?    Last Friday Katie noticed Corona wasn‚Äôt acting like herself.¬† She stopped eating and drinking and became very weak, even falling down the stairs at one point. Heartbroken, Katie rushed Corona to the veterinarian and ER to learn that Corona‚Äôs gallbladder was about to rupture and required emergency surgery. Time was of the essence.  Katie was then faced with an unimaginable decision: put her best friend down or fight and pay the high costs of surgery.¬† While many people may have given up, Katie knew there was only one option, to fight. Her exact words to us were  ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt look her [Corona] in the eye and tell her she‚Äôs not worth it. I have to give her my best.‚Äù       How your donation will help?    As most of you know, emergency veterinarian bills and surgery can be quite expensive. Katie has already spent $2,200 on pre-operation costs alone.¬† Surgery to remove Corona‚Äôs gallbladder is $4,000 and Katie will incur another $4,000 in post-operation costs.¬†   This financial burden is a hard on any loving pet owner, but with your help and the help of many others we can accomplish a lot.¬† Thank you in advance for all of your love and support during this very difficult time.

            "description": "\r\n This is... Awkward for me. \r\n \r\n\r\n I have a hard time asking friends and family (let alone strangers) for help. As the bread winner for a family of four, I take great pride in my self reliance and resource management skills. My credit rating, while not spectacular, is good and I have never missed a bill. \r\n \r\n\r\n However, this year has been particularily unkind to my family and we are struggling. \r\n \r\n\r\n It started great, with me landing a new job at an amazing company (ABC Supply), but as soon as February hit, our problems began. \r\n \r\n\r\n My mother in law, whom we had been taking care of at our home, tragically lost her battle with cancer. Once the sadness and emptiness of her loss began to slowly recede, the realities of our new economic situation began to quickly set in. We had to take care of her estate, which included her debts, as well as handle bills, taxes, insurances and utilities for two homes, now. Hers and ours. \r\n \r\n\r\n Expenses started to accrue, along with our credit card debt. We've struggled, but somehow managed by the skin of our teeth. \r\n \r\n\r\n Then Friday October 20th happened. \r\n \r\n\r\n I started to feel pain in my abdomen, which made it very hard to sleep. By Sunday the 22nd I was in agony, so my wife took me to the ER. After a CT scan, I was diagnosed with Diverticulitis and sent home with prescriptions for antibiotics and pain medication. \r\n \r\n\r\n On Monday the 23rd, I almost fainted while waiting for those prescriptions, and then again on Tuesday the 24th just by getting up to use the restroom. That same afternoon, I was back in the ER. \r\n \r\n\r\n The diverticular infection had not only gotten worse, but had now caused a perforation in my bowels. \r\n \r\n\r\n It is now November 6th, two weeks later, and I am scheduled for surgery tomorrow, which will take between 4\" and 8\" off my colon, as well as carrying a 10% to 20% chance of me ending with a colostomy bag. \r\n \r\n\r\n As I mentioned before, I am the bread winner for my family. While my job does provide me with health insurance; after all copays, deductibles and associated fees are coupled with lost wages, my family will be left in a very precarious situation. \r\n \r\n\r\n This is why, with my loved ones in mind, that I am mustering up the courage to swallow my pride and ask our dear friends, family and kind strangers who happen upon this campaign for help. Not for myself, but for my wife, daughter and son. \r\n \r\n\r\n Anything I have ever done is, has been and will always be for them. \r\n \r\n\r\n If you donate, thank you from the bottom of my heart for helping me take care of my family. And if you don't, thank you for taking the time to read my story. \r\n \r\n",

Last week I got my results from my pet scan and even though my faith was strong and I declared victory; the news was bad. I found out that not only did the chemo not work but my cancer progressed. It has now moved to my liver. I used to have three lymph nodes and now I‚Äôm at 9. The three that I already had never shrunk enough to clear me of cancer. Within 6 weeks I grew 6 more. My only option now is stronger chemo because Cisplatin didn‚Äôt work. I maxed out on radiation so that‚Äôs no longer an option. The side effects are horrible, I can no longer walk for long periods of time. Pretty soon I‚Äôll have to use a wheel chair. Sometimes my feet go completely numb but it‚Äôs a constant pain. Although I look very strong on the outside, my body is getting weaker by the day. Although all this is happening my faith is still in the same place that it was on day 1. I pray that god will continue to give me strength because this new chemo they‚Äôre going to give me is nothing like the low dose I had before. My hair is certain to fall off and the effects will be way worse. I had a beautiful birthday and wouldn‚Äôt have wanted it to go any other way than it did. Sometimes I get sad and want to give up but all the love and support I receive keeps me going. I just want to thank you all for the prayers you send my way. It never goes unnoticed and I‚Äôm very grateful for it all. I believe that god will heal me soon ! I‚Äôm blessed to not be fighting this battle alone  We are reaching out to ALL of Rosalindas Family , Friends   Supporters to help us win this battle.

I got started 5 years ago when I decided to teach my daughter that Christmas was not only about gifts but about bringing joy to the less fortunate. Every year we have donated to different organizations including women's shelters, missions, the children's hospital, and a neighborhood church. This year we decided to take a different approach. A few weeks ago our dog went missing, during our exhausting search to get our little guy back home we stopped by the Carson animal shelter. It was heartbreaking to see so many loveable animals without a home with the holidays quickly approaching. Unfortunately every year the shelter is heavily impacted with helpless animals. The shelter tries their best to provide a safe and loving place for these animals to live until they are adopted. All our donations this year will go towards supplying the shelter with necessary items such as leashes, collars, blankets, heat lamps, and steal bowls. Extra funds will be used to provide grooming services for the dogs to make them more attractive to potential adoptions. Our mission every year survives on the generosity of our supporters thanks in advance. Happy Holidays!",

This famine crisis increases to affect more and more adults and children every day; and, that's why we ask for YOUR help.  Our foundation has been helping orphanages, elderly care centers, religious institutions and non-governmental organizations- we have reached communities from the most populated cities to the Amazon forest. We are attending more than 350 foundations in different states throughout the country.¬†  Your donation will help many more Venezuelan families in need. The money we collect will be fundamentally used to purchase certain types of medicines, non-perishable foods, shipping and handling costs- including emergency shipments, and many other required costs in order to be able to give our fellow Venezuelans the resources that they so desperately need, at the moment in which they need them, and at the location in which they need them.¬†   VENEZUELA WANTS TO LIVE...¬† HELP US TO HELP THEM!!!!

Sadly, after 2 surgeries, chemo, radiation, endoscopic procedures and 4 hospital stays, the cancer just wouldnt let up. After our last attempt to have a stint placed failed, Phil and I were informed that nothing else medically could be done for him. The cancer has spread over most if not all his abdominal area and he is no longer able to eat or receive nourishment. We were sat down and were given all our options but with only weeks left to live no matter what we attempted, Phil and I made the decision to come home and receive hospice care to be near our children and family. I brought Phil home from Stanford hospial last Saturday on Feb 3rd. Everyday, my husband gets a little more withdrawn and everyday his condition worsens. The doctors can tell you what to expect but they cant prepare you for the pain and heartache it causes to watch the man you love slowly lose the laughter and light from his eyes.

            "description": " BACKSTORY  As you may or may not know, my wonderful mother Dawn Corona went into surgery for heart valve replacement March 16th. The surgery was successful but due to other unseen factors and a long time on the operating table my mother became ill. On¬†monday morning(3/19) Dawns family was called to say goodbye because they did not think she could make it. By the grace of God a surgeon was willing to perform an exploratory surgery on her abdomen to determine what was happening.  The cause of my mothers decline in health was properly diagnosed and the doctors began working to fix her and return her to a normal condition. There are a few procedures and surgeries on the horizon we still have yet to conquer but these are hurdles we are glad to face because of  the wonderful and profound beauty¬† my Mom brings to all of our lives.   HOW YOU CAN HELP  Due to unforeseen circumstances Dawns week long stay at the hospital has turned into something that we are not yet sure the length of. Our family has drawn close together so we can help¬† our most precious Dawn . Because of the distance from home, it is getting increasingly harder to maintain a healthy lifestyle. We are in need of funds for groceries, lodging, and transportation uses. $14 a day parking is adding up quite fast, and a number of other issues are beginning to make themselves known.  My main concern is that we are able to be here for my mother, She has directly stated she did not want to be left alone at anytime. This is something we are doing our best to accomplish but there is some difficulty in being 57 miles away from Corona. Having a hotel that family members can rotate through to shower or nap is needed, having gas and parking money will be crucial moving forward as well.¬†  I wish I could explain all of the issues moving forward, but to be honest being at the hospital is our lives right now. We will be facing many more issues once they let us take our dear Dawn home for recovery. We need your help even before getting back to square one.¬†  Let me be clear in stating that my Mothers life is still hanging in the balance. God has protected her for 49 yrs and I think God will continue to do so for many more. We are trusting the doctors and surgeons to have blessed hands. I will Inform everyone of more details as I am given permission for them to be made public, so thank you for your patience and we are grateful for your support, I will be giving you updates as soon as I can",

            "description": " Hello all and loved ones,   My name is Isabel, and about 3 months ago, my best friend Ivan Heredia and his family received life changing news that has severely impacted their lives.    How We Got Here   As some of you may know, Ivan was in and out of the hospital the past several months, trying to find a diagnosis for his breathing problems. His lungs have suffered irreparable scarring, and inflammation which prevents him from breathing normally, causing his oxygen levels to drop dangerously low (currently, without respiratory equipment, he cannot breathe on his own). The Pulmonary Specialists at UCLA Medical Center have diagnosed him with a rare disease called 'Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome,' (HPS) which is directly linked to his albinism.    His Current Status   Ivan was initially being treated at Riverside Community Hospital, but due to the rarity of his disease, he is now being treated at UCLA Medical Center, where hehas been cleared to undergo a double lung transplant. Due to the distance from his home in Riverside, he and his family will be forced to temporarily move as close as possible to the transplant center at UCLA to receive the intensive care after the transplant surgery. Part of the evaluation to determine his diagnosis of HPS included genetic testing, which is not covered by his health insurance, and will need to be paid out of pocket.  Currently, Ivan's wife Leticia, is faced with going back and forth between UCLA, work, and taking care of their two young children (Israel, 10 years and Emmilia, 17 months).   What Now?   Double lung transplants are expensive.  The pre and post transplant care is, as you can imagine, complex and critical. The medications, routine doctor visits, and costs for housing near the transplant center post-transplant surgery add up immensely.  I am reaching out to everyone who may or may not personally know Ivan, because I want to help raise funds for him and his family to cover direct expenses that are not covered by his health insurance. My goal is to give them a peace of mind, at least financially, throughout the process to a healthy recovery.  If you could please support my friend and his family by making a financial donation, and subsequently share it with your network, it would be most appreciated. Asking for money is difficult, but even the smallest amount of help can make a difference to help Ivan and his family at this time.¬†  Please feel free to reach out to me, or Ivan's siblings (Jonathan  jonathan.heredia@gmail.com  and Johanna  joredia@gmail.com  ) if you have any questions, or feel more comfortable donating in a different way.   Let's Help Ivan Breathe.    ",

            "title": "My nephew's cancer story",
            "description": "On Saturday, April 14th, we took my nephew to the emergency room because he was feeling sick. ¬†Little did we know that this emergency visit would change our entire lives.  My nephew was immediately admitted to the Pediatric Cancer Care unit. For that entire week my nephew was in and out of labs: x-ray, CT scan, PET scan, MRI, and biopsies. On Wednesday, April 18th, he was diagnosed with Ewing‚Äôs Sarcoma Cancer at his short age of 14.  Nothing is scarier than waiting for days in the hospital for answers, and then being told that my nephew has cancer. My entire family was rapidly swamped with medical terminology, life-threatening risks, and long and complex words we have never heard of, especially not a child. Yet we were expected to make immediate, crucial decisions that would drastically impact my nephew‚Äôs life and future.  Doctors began his chemotherapy the next day after his diagnosis. Due to the fact that the tumor was too big to be removed via surgery he had to immediately begin chemotherapy.  A cancer diagnosis is not the end; it is only the beginning. My nephew will undergo chemo for approximately 12 weeks, followed by a surgery, radiation, and months of medication and hospital visits. With every appointment, procedure, and treatment comes a cost. A cost, that I believe no family is ever prepared for.  My sister will be out of work to care for him throughout his entire treatment. All donations raised will help offset costs associated with this diagnosis, treatment and care. He will not fight this battle alone. Any help (prayer, donation or share) that you can give him will be greatly appreciated and will help him overcome the most important hurdle of his young life.  If you have ever seen a child fight cancer it will change you outlook on life forever! Anything you can donate will be truly appreciated. We look forward in seeing my nephew grow, graduate high school and one day college.  THE TRUTH BEHIND THE NUMBERS: Ewing‚Äôs Sarcoma is a rare type of cancer that usually occurs in children and young adults between the ages of 10 and 20. ¬†It is highly malignant and can metastasize (spread) rapidly to other areas of the body. Unfortunately, childhood cancer is underfunded for many reasons. For more information on childhood cancer, please visit:   https://www.acco.org/research/  .¬†  Again, we appreciate your time, help and support.  God bless you.     El s√°bado 14 de abril llevamos a mi sobrino a la sala de emergencias porque se sent√≠a enfermo. Poco sab√≠amos que esta visita de emergencia cambiar√≠a nuestras vidas enteras.  Mi sobrino fue admitido de inmediato en la unidad de atenci√≥n pedi√°trica contra el c√°ncer. Durante toda esa semana, mi sobrino entr√≥ y sali√≥ de los laboratorios: rayos X, tomograf√≠a computarizada, tomograf√≠a por emisi√≥n de positrones, resonancia magn√©tica y biopsias. El mi√©rcoles 18 de abril, le diagnosticaron c√°ncer de sarcoma de Ewing a su corta edad de 14 a√±os.  Nada es m√°s aterrador que esperar d√≠as en el hospital para obtener respuestas, y luego nos digan que mi sobrino tiene c√°ncer. Toda mi familia fue inundada r√°pidamente con terminolog√≠a m√©dica, riesgos que amenazan la vida y palabras largas y complejas de las que nunca hemos o√≠do, especialmente ningun ni√±o. Sin embargo, se esperaba que tom√°ramos decisiones inmediatas y cruciales que impactaran dr√°sticamente la vida y el futuro de mi sobrino.  Los m√©dicos comenzaron su quimioterapia al d√≠a siguiente despu√©s de su diagn√≥stico. Debido al hecho de que el tumor era demasiado grande para extraerlo mediante cirug√≠a, tuvo que comenzar inmediatamente con la quimioterapia.  Un diagn√≥stico de c√°ncer no es el final; Es solo el principio. Mi sobrino se someter√° a quimioterapia durante aproximadamente 12 semanas, seguido de una cirug√≠a, radiaci√≥n y meses de medicamentos y visitas al hospital. Con cada cita, procedimiento y tratamiento hay un costo. Un costo, que creo que ninguna familia est√° preparada.  Mi hermana estar√° sin trabajo para cuidarlo durante todo su tratamiento. Todas las donaciones recaudadas ayudar√°n a compensar los costos asociados con este diagn√≥stico, tratamiento y cuidado. √âl no pelear√° esta batalla solo. Cualquier ayuda (oraci√≥n, donaci√≥n o compartir) que pueda darle ser√° muy apreciada y lo ayudar√° a superar el obst√°culo m√°s dificil de su corta vida.  Si alguna vez has visto a un ni√±o luchar contra el c√°ncer, ¬°te cambiar√° la perspectiva de la vida para siempre! Todo lo que pueda donar ser√° realmente apreciado. Esperamos ver crecer a mi sobrino saludablemente, graduarce de la escuela secundaria y un d√≠a ir a la universidad.¬†  LA VERDAD DETR√ÅS DE LOS N√öMEROS: El sarcoma de Ewing es un tipo raro de c√°ncer que generalmente ocurre en ni√±os y adultos j√≥venes entre las edades de 10 y 20. Es altamente maligno y puede hacer met√°stasis (propagarse) r√°pidamente a otras √°reas del cuerpo. Desafortunadamente, el c√°ncer infantil no cuenta con fondos suficientes por muchas razones. Para obtener m√°s informaci√≥n sobre el c√°ncer infantil, visite:   https://www.acco.org/research/  ¬†.  Nuevamente, apreciamos su tiempo, ayuda y apoyo.  Dios lo bendiga.  ",

As first time parents, they¬†were both excited and nervous to begin this new chapter in their lives. Unfortunately, Xiomara has yet to see the outside of a hospital. She¬†was diagnosed with a rare medical condition called congenital hyperinsulinism, a condition that affects only 1 in every¬†50,000 newborns. Medication proved unsuccesful¬†and now¬†Xiomara has been¬†flown from Arizona to Texas where she is ¬†facing the prospect¬†¬†of surgery at just four weeks of age.  Few of us will ever experience the emotional rollercoaster Diana and David have been on recently, so we want to help them by lessening their financial burden. Diana is currently¬†on¬†maternity leave and does not know if and when she can return to her fourth grade teaching position. David has also taken time off of work and will continue to do so to remain by his daughter's side during this trying time. Therefore, all donated funds will go directly to the Corona family to help alleviate the financial stress incurred from the hospital stays, ambulance rides, and helicopter flights.  Diana, David, and Xiomara need your love and support. Please¬†use this page to donate or reach out to Daisy if you would like to help in another way. No donation is too small.¬† Every dollar donated is greatly appreciated and will go a long way in helping the Coronas successfully begin this next chapter in their lives.¬†   Please share this page with all of your social networks.

Along with her divorce still pending and now put to the side as courthouses have closed also during this time, both her jobs have closed(shes applied for assurance other places, but isnt sure on amounts and if or when those will be available. She's been forced out of work, her children are home from school and with social distancing child care is hard to find and limited for her to go apply at other places currently. I'm hoping by switching this fund to COVID-19 support for the time being the community can help supplement some til she's able to get back to work to help her maintain the essentials for her and her children during this time. She's wanting to leave food banks and meal handouts to those who are in worse shape than herself currently. Thanks to anyone who takes the time to read,share and donate.

She juggles working multiple jobs, school for the kids, their homework and projects also their extracurricular activities which keep them on the go alot.¬†¬†\r\n\r\n\r\nDue to her attempts to end the divorce quickly, cheaply and peacefully hes decided to go the other route in which now unfortunately the children may be stuck in the middle of it despite her efforts to avoid that.¬†\r\n\r\n\r\nI started¬† this page¬† awhile ago when i found out he stopped helping with support all together to help her with bills,¬† she only¬† used it for awhile and i restarted it once things got moving¬† in the court system and he was running up her legal fees.

For about 6 months, my dad was having excruciating pain in his groin, and eventually, we were told it is prostate cancer. Luckily, it is in its early stages, and it has not spread. ¬†My dad‚Äôs surgery was originally scheduled for June 29th, but was moved to the end of July because of my dad‚Äôs weight. He has been working hard for a couple months and has been doing great, but our doctor wants him to lose more for his own safety, and for the procesures chances of working to increase.¬†While we are thankful for the early stage cancer, we are struggling financially. My family has never been crazy rich, but we also don‚Äôt survive off off every paycheck. My dad is self-employed, which means he has to work to make money, and doesn‚Äôt have a given ‚Äúsalary‚Äù each year- it all depends on his amount of work done. My mom works with the school system, so we are down paychecks until school starts up again. My parents are both incredibly hard-working people who always put us, her kids, before them. Always. My parents don‚Äôt ask for other people‚Äôs help, but lately, the vibes in the house rough. We are tight on food and also have very very many animals to take care of (16 to be exact). We would really appreciate any donations, we need every bit that we can get right now. Please share this link to everyone you know. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this; I appreciate it!",

            "description": " Hello everybody! As I‚Äôve been updating pics and my work status on social media I‚Äôm sure you have figured that I am no longer with my previous employer. I started off at that franchise 11 1/2 years ago with the intentions of never really leaving and working my way up the ranks. ¬†At the time I was hired, I started in the office as a customer service representative. ¬†No positions were available in the field so I figured that I would make it out eventually. I worked my way up through the company as planned through out the years from data entry, scheduling appointments, and managing the Hawaii branch remotely from Orange County. ¬†I was finally given the chance to be a technicians helper in the field after 5 long years of office work. This is when the hard work started and I figured out plumbing would be my life long career. I started by assisting in locating and repairing leaks on pool/spa systems. ¬†After a couple of years assisting in pools, I moved on to my apprenticeship in residential leak locating and repairs. I was given the opportunity to run my own truck as a technician after all the training. Within 2 years I hit the ceiling and became Orange County‚Äôs top producing technician but I didn‚Äôt feel satisfied with the limited knowledge of plumbing that I had gained.   My next step was to move on to another company which was much more versed in all aspects of plumbing from residential, commercial, industrial, service plumbing, repairs, remodels, and new construction. The pace was so fast and the days were so long that it felt as though I learned 5 years worth of plumbing within a 1 years span that I was with this 2nd company. ¬†  After some hardship due to the limited amount of time I had with my family, I decided I needed to go back to my original employer in order to slow the pace down again and figure out my next move. ¬†When I got back to my old employer I realized that the skill sets that I acquired throughout my career no longer fit in with the companies structure. ¬†I was being used to train others such as helpers and senior technicians as to what I had learned without being compensated. ¬†The company let me go because I didn‚Äôt agree to work for free. ¬†Now suddenly I was left jobless and with a family of 5 daughters and a wife to provide for. ¬†I took this as a sign and the opportunity to begin my own plumbing empire. ¬†During this time it not only humbled me but gave me the drive to pursue my dream. ¬†This is when EROCK Plumbing and Repipe went from being a dream to something I need to achieve.   The name EROCK Plumbing and Repipe is dedicated to my best friend Erik Ortiz that passed in a tragic accident in 2014. Knowing that he had always wanted to be a boss but never got the chance to do so, this is my way of fulfilling his dream as well.   Since I‚Äôve been unemployed I have continued with submitting all my legal documents to register my business name,license,and tax i.d. # with the state. I have enrolled in school to gain my plumbing license so that once the legal documents are processed I can take my test to then become a legitimate company.   I intend on using my platform in the community to also support awareness of Substance abuse, depression awareness, and breast cancer awareness. ¬† I‚Äôm asking asking for your help. I‚Äôm asking for donations to fund the purchase of a used utility truck, any more business fees that may need to be paid, equipment purchases, and create a home office. ¬†  My wife will be the manager/ co owner and I also intend on bringing more family on board to create EROCK Plumbing. ¬†  Any amount of donation will be greatly appreciated and will be utilized towards the final goal of this business start up. You have all been very supportive in my mission to become a Plumbing entrepreneur and I want to thank you for being a part of my journey. You are all considered a part of the EROCK Plumbing family by donating.   This is definitely out of my character to ask for help but it definitely needed. Thank You!¬† ¬†  Miguel Ortega",

The two families are related and have lived above the space occupied by IMI Corona for the past 11 years.¬†¬†IMI Corona, a valued community center and refuge for immigrant families, recently received word that they have to leave the space where they have built a strong connection to the surrounding community.¬†¬†Just like IMI Corona, the two families above the space also suddenly received notices that stated they had until August 31st¬†to move out or face going to housing court.  IMI Corona and the two families are being evicted by the same landlord, Robert Gans, who has a 17 building real-estate portfolio that includes Metropolitan Lumber   Hardware, the old Scores strip club and a dozen other commercial buildings in Corona and Astoria, one of which houses a senior center that is also being evicted.¬†  With August 31st¬†fast approaching, the two families have been searching for affordable apartments to move into.¬†¬†This has been made difficult by the wave of gentrification that has swept Western Queens and has caused rents in Corona to soar.¬†¬†The donations collected through this campaign will help the two families pay for part of their security deposits or brokers‚Äô fees‚Äîthe total being split between the two families.

Nosotros somos un grupo de activistas en Queens y estamos luchando en contra del desplazamiento con fines de mantener a estas dos familias en Corona. Estas familias inmigrantes han vivido en Corona por 11 a√±os y est√°n siendo expulsadas por su due√±o de casa. Necesitamos de urguencia recaudir fondos.¬†¬†  IMI Corona es un espacio muy valorado en Queens y sirve como un centro communitario e un refugio para inmigrantes. Hace poco IMI Corona fue notificado que tendr√° quedesalojar del espacio muy pronto. Tal como a IMI Corona a las familias tambien le dieron una fecha del 31 de Agosto para desalojarse o ir al tribunal de viviendas.¬†  IMI Corona y las dos familias est√°n siendo desalojadas por el mismo due√±o de casa, Robert Gans, quien es due√±o de 17 edificios incluyendo¬†Metropolitan Lumber   Hardware, un strip club Scores NY, y otra docena de edificios comerciales en Corona y Astoria. Uno de esos edificios es un asilo de la tercera edad lo cual tambien esta siendo desalojado.¬†  Con el 31 de Agosto en unos cuantos dias las familias han estado desesperadamente buscando departamentos asequibles sin suerte. En si esta busqueda por viviendas asequibles en Queens es parte de una ola de aburguesamiento que esta arrasando con la ciudad de Nueva York. Las donaciones seran colectadas a medio de esta campagna virtual lo cual sera compartido entre las dos familias. La plata recaudida ira a pagar el deposito de seguro y para un \"brokers' fee\".¬†  Usted puede leer el testimonio de IMI Corona acerca de la situacion aqui:   Testimonio p√∫blica de IMI Corona ¬†  Se le agradece mucho!

            "description": "\r\n Hello!¬†  You may know me online as \"Javanshir\" or \"beiua\", but if you were around even further in the past you'd know that my actual name is Edgar Corona.\r\n \r\n\r\n I have been with my wife Gabrielle since October of 2007, and we have been married since August of 2012. We recently bought our first home in Southern Oregon; a 3-bedroom home that I have been actively remodeling the interior myself, with aspirations of starting a family. However, it has been evident that we are unable to naturally start our own family...\r\n \r\n\r\n In 2014, my wife Gabrielle had an ectopic pregnancy. That is, a pregnancy that begins within the fallopian tubes instead of the uterus. This resulted in a very early-stage miscarriage. In 2015, she had an additional ectopic pregnancy, however this pregnancy resulted in the need for emergency surgery. This surgery was when we discovered she had the said miscarriage in 2014---and now both fallopian tubes are scarred shut, and we have been told attempts to \"repair\" the fallopian tubes is infeasible. She is no longer fertile.\r\n \r\n\r\n That said, we have been looking at the other options. We spent a weekend taking state-required classes for foster and/or adoption. We looked into adopting an international child. But in the end we still dream of the idea of conceiving our own children... however these are still a fallback plan, just in case.   This is where the \"In-Vitro\" process comes into play. For those who don't know what In-Vitro is, the simplest way I can describe it is a petri dish baby that is eventually injected for potential implantation. \r\n \r\n\r\n ...if only it were that easy! We recently received our In-Vitro Fertilization schedule, so the ball is now rolling, and it is a daunting process of costly drugs, carefully scheduled to be used for weeks on end along with regular medical consultations at an office that is hours away. We are only able to afford a small handful of these costs, along with the inevitable cost of driving to and from the clinic and missing time from work. I work for Anheuser-Busch and my health insurance does not cover infertility procedures. My wife works in the banking industry and her insurance only covers the consultations.¬†\r\n \r\n\r\n The nature of using the drugs needed in the In-Vitro process is already scary enough... and to see the costs is even worse! We are both scared but very hopeful. The chances of In-Vitro working as intended is very slim and often requires repeated attempts... but the repeated attempts means higher cost. There may be a point when we run out of funds to try again and simply become hopeless.\r\n \r\n\r\n I'm not sure how to say this, but we need help. From anyone. Any amount of donations would be beneficial for us, no matter how small. I am reaching out to anyone because we have done everything we can so far. We have a home, careers, family, but no financial assistance for In-Vitro Fertilization procedures.\r\n \r\n\r\n If anyone can help us in this matter we will be eternally grateful. Our goal is $12,000 because that is the initial quoted amount for a single attempt. Repeated attempts are said to cost less but we are hopeful on a first attempt being successful! But again any amount helps us more than you can imagine. Any questions are welcomed.\r\n \r\n\r\n Thank you for reading!¬†\r\n \r\n\r\n ¬†\r\n \r\n\r\n [edit 8/5: We learned our insurance covers some of the basic medications such as the birth control required to put her on a more controlled menstrual cycle, and antibiotics we both need to take prior to September. For this among other reasons, the initial quoted amount has been reduced]\r\n ",

She just got a spot in the Tournament of Rose Honor Band and Color Guard. She is the first out of state student to be marching with this amazing organization in it‚Äôs 90 year history. But along will that comes a price. Piper will be receiving college credit for this but because she is out of state we have to pay out of state tuition which isn‚Äôt cheap. I have never been one to spoil my kids I know how to say no but one thing I will not say no to is her education and following her dreams, especially when I see her talent. I work almost 6 days a week and when I‚Äôm not working I‚Äôm volunteering my time with school color guard just to be involved in her life. And I hate to say it but her father has pretty much turned his back on her and we get no help from him. I do all I can to make sure she can live her dreams, even putting off my back surgery. See I already lived my dreams and now I want to see her live hers!!! Piper and I work as a team, we have sold about 10 boxes of chocolates together to pay off her fall season fees and travel fees, so trust me we don‚Äôt sit around just asking for donations and money. They say always ask, the worst that happens is someone says no and there‚Äôs no better support then from your family and friends. So please find it in your heart, not for me but for Piper to support her dreams even if it‚Äôs just $1. We both truly appreciate your kindness and generosity from the bottom of our hearts‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è Thank You!!!!!",

            "description": " To whom may read this,  First, thank you so much for taking the time to read my message.   This all begins with me meeting Kristina towards the end of 2010 online ( we met on MySpace, I believe). We started dating and not long into it, 3 weeks or so, she gets arrested for child neglect ( see link )  http://archive.tcpalm.com/news/fort-pierce-mom-arrested-after-tot-found-alone-on-street-home-filthyep-388567336-345582252.html/  . I decided to take the police report and news reports with a grain of salt and kept the relationship going while she was in jail. When she got out of jail (about 2 months later) she moved in with me since her mother moved during the time of her incarceration. Due to failure to show progress to the court, her case worker, and to myself not only had she lost her daughter to the father living another state away, she lost a boyfriend who had seen her disregard for what happened.    It was Nov of 2011 when I bought her a bus ticket to live with her mother in TN (Crossville), about 5 months later I get a phone call from an unknown number that happens to be her on the other end saying I ruined her life and that she's pregnant. Given the amount of time we had gone without seeing each other I asked for proof like a picture of herself pregnant. She refused and I didn't hear from her after that. 2 months later she ends back up in Fort Pierce, FL, my home town. I notice she actually is pregnant and the time line fits. To make sure they both are OK I agree to take her to appointments, buy her food etc.. but I wouldn't buy anything for the baby or give her money without a paternity test. In short I suggested that she save all the necessary receipts and I'd gladly pay what I owe. Upset that I didn't want a relationship, she began telling me things in spite, i.e \" He won't have your last name, I'm going to name him after your ex's new bf. I will admit that she managed to make me upset, to the point where I did tell her that if he is mine I will take him away. From there she leaves to a state unknown to me to have the baby.  Fast forward 6 months: she reaches out with an alias and a picture of a little boy that looks just like me. I get a couple pictures and short dialogue before she ask me for money. I told her we need this done right so I want to go through court and establish paternity and get her set up with child support. With that said the cycle repeats itself and now she is completely under the radar.    It has been 6 years since and during that time I've contacted IRS, DCF, CPI, everyone short of a private investigator to let them know a woman is claiming I have a son with her and I want to find him. No one would help me unless she filed for state services and since she could be anywhere there was no way to know where to begin. Nevertheless the search began, although no one I could reach knew where she was or who she was with. I could only hope she would pop up, and I left every social media outlet available to me open with full contact information in case she ever wanted to try contacting me again.   In July of this year, through Facebook friend suggestion algorithm , I noticed a woman that resembled Kristina. I click on the page and sure enough, it was her! I reach out to her with full understanding she could delete her account and disappear again. This time, that wasn't the case. She was actually willing to talk, saying that he (my son) already has a dad and my son is very well off. That he has a grandmother now and a family. I was OK with everything she was saying, I just wanted to know he was doing well and wanted to build rapport with her again. A month goes by and she tells me after talking to her fiance they agreed to introduce me to Daniel and explain to him I'm his father. Danny and I had a few face to face video calls, it was great! he even got to meet one of his sisters on video and luckily I was able to screen shot them talking for the first time! After about a week of finally getting to that point things started to unfold with her situation. She began asking if I could take her in for a while because her fiance is mean to my son and grandmother is equally as mean and she can't take it anymore so I told her to let me think it over.    ¬† (The first time Danny and Destiny were met)  Out of nowhere I got a phone call from a number in Pennsylvania. My roommate is also from PA so I thought it was for him and answered the phone. An elder woman asks if I'm Mynor to which I replied I was.   She says \" I'm Katie and I'm the person your son has been calling grandma\". We get well acquainted and she started emailing me photos of Daniel which was heaven sent, but was shocked when I heard what she had to say, which in summary, was she is retired from school administration, a Sunday school assistant and her husband Lee is retired NYPD. She had been looking into me and came to the conclusion the person Kristina was describing Danny's father to be was very much untrue, that she believed Daniel was not in the best of care with her (Katie's) son and Kristina ( now Chelsea) and began telling me all the ways she felt he was being mistreated. How prior to Kristina moving to PA she was living in a drug home that had just got busted according to her son, that she called Lancaster child and youth services, and welfare fraud to report her for what she called \" neglect of Daniels well being and abuse of government assistance\". Since Kristina found out what Katie had done after the visit from a case worker she sent Daniel away on which she called it a vacation and she followed shortly there after but not before blocking me from contact. Since reconnecting with her son, Katie was able to have her son open up about things and he felt guilty about what happened so he's trying to help with information. With the information I have obtained I hired a private investigator to track them down. With amazingly quick results I now know she is back in TN and has a brand new fiance and a new alias ( now Michelle) on social media after less than a month from leaving PA and ex Fiance. With this I now have her address and I have to have documents served.   This is where you come in. I have exhausted all other resources at my disposal. My ultimate goal is to get full custody. This little boy, my son, has sisters, aunts, uncles, a big family and support system waiting for him. He would have all the attention a growing boy needs and many willing to help me provide guidance for him as he grows but the longer I wait the possibility grows she'll find out and once again leave and would have to start the search again.   I'm begging you, the reader to understand this is not for me. This is for Daniel. His future. The money donated to this cause will go towards legal fees, and anything needed/related that would help Daniel and his family reunite.    Your patience for reading this, understanding of the situation, and contribution is greatly appreciated from the bottom of my heart and thank you for your consideration. If any questions, concerns or words of advice feel free to reach out to me.  Mynor Corona",

Just days before his birthday on January 18, 2018 he became gravely ill and was absent from school. Shortly after his birthday, his physician sent Jacob to Lurie Children's Hospital in Chicago for further testing and it was discovered that he had cancer in his blood. The diagnosis was Childhood Leukemia. This was devastating to hear for Ms. Corona, Jacob's mom, as she is a single parent. Originally from Mexico, Ms. Corona came to this country to seek a better life. She has a wonderful son who she considers a blessing. She is naturally distraught at the prospect of having to take a leave of absence from work to provide round the clock care for Jacob. Her employer issued insurance will run out when the sick leave ends as the treatment for Jacob will take three (3) years. Ms. Corona is fearful that not having any income at the moment she will not be able to pay her rent and bills. Any donations you are able to contribute will be greatly appreciated. These donations will help her manage the expense of driving into downtown Chicago for his weekly treatments, purchase the medical supplies and prescription medicines that he needs, and make it possible for Ms. Corona to purchase groceries to keep up with the dietary needs of her son. Thank you for your prayers and donations. The road to recovery is long and the aggressive chemotherapy and blood transfusions are going to take their toll on little Jacob. But with your prayers and support, we hope to make it a little easier for the Corona Family to deal with the financial hardship they are beginning to endure. *******************\r\nJULY 16 2019 JACOB HAS RELAPSED AND WE ARE STARTING HIS FUNDRAISING EFFORTS ALL OVER. UNFORTUNATELY THERE IS NO WAY TO RESET THE AMOUNT TO ZERO SO IT IS STILL SHOWING THE $5,400 WE THANKFULLY RAISED FOR THE FAMILY WITH HIS FIRST BATTLE BUT AS WE KNOW THE LIVING EXPENSES, PARKING EXPENSES, ETC. ENDURED THE 1ST TIME AROUND USED UP THE ENTIRE AMOUNT RAISED. WE DO APPRECIATE ANY AND ALL DONATIONS WE CAN RAISE FOR THIS SECOND BATTLE THE CORONA FAMILY IS ABOUT TO ENDURE. JACOB'S mom had to once again quit her Job after just returning a few months ago when he went into remission, however a few months back when Mrs.Corona was told he was in remission and his treatments would be less frequent and she got the OK to put him in Daycare she did and quickly returned to work! She is a very hardworking mom but unfortunately now that he has relapsed and is having weekly chemotherapy and weekly bloodwork and this is just the beginning of another much more aggressive treatment her priority is being at Jacob's side, so she had to resign from her job. The Unity In Community is supporting a fundraiser hosted by The American Legion for Jacob on 8/30/2019, you can find more information on his FB page and you can check for future event or other future fundraisers, it's Jacob Strong - Jacob Corona. We are extremely grateful to everyone for past and future donations! He is scheduled for his 3rd Chemotherapy treatment for the relapse on 8/19/2019.\r\nUpdate March 2020\r\nJacob has continued with Chemotherapy, since the relapse he's done 3 different chemotherapies each bonemarrow biopsy shows they've helped but bot enough to where he qualifies for a bonemarrow transplant. \r\nThe best and only option at this time is getting Stem cells from his original donor in Hope's to bring the cancer percentage down enough to qualify him for a transplant or wipe it out completely. Jacob is currently scheduled to start a 6 days chemotherapy treatment on March 11th to prepare him to receive the cells that his very amazing donor has agreed to give him. He is due to get the cells on March 17th. This is will be tough on Jacob but he is a resilient child and very strong we have faith that he will be ok.",

            "description": "  ¬† ¬†Only the Best for the Gates of Heaven    ¬† ¬† When we lose a loved one, we are often left with the why questions. ¬†As well as the woulda, coulda, shoulda's. One might take solace in knowing that our dearly departed is with the lord and that others, who have preceded them in death, will be there to greet them. However, there is a special peace that comes with the notion that the Lord takes only the best first. Sometimes it might be true and others we simply only see the best. ¬†For those good memories, are what keeps the departed alive in our hearts. ¬†For, Maria Conception Corona, that notion is the absolute truth. ¬†    ¬† ¬† On Saturday morning, January 12, 2019, Concha, as family and friends called her, lost her life and everything that represented her and her memory to a tragic house fire. ¬†As the matriarch in her family, she leaves behind 4 children, 12 grandchildren and 3 great grandchildren.    ¬† ¬† We are reaching out to anyone who can help the family with funeral expenses. ¬†In addition, her husband and youngest son, Michael, who made it out of the fire are in need of basic items. ¬†The fire was so overwhelming, it consumed all they owned.    ¬† ¬† Mario and Michael Corona, wish only to have Concha back. ¬†On their behalf, we humbly ask that anyone who has any clothing, underwear, shoes, socks, jackets, new or used , would please donate, them. ¬†You may contact the person whom is responsible for your awareness of the situation or the family directly. ¬†Anna Corona at (480) 888-5629 or Roy Corona at (919) 423-0156.    ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†The irony? While the family only wants her back, without thought of material items, Concha, the nurturer that she was, would be¬†asking for help to take care of her family if she could. ¬†    When you leave a donation, you can leave a message for the family. This will help in their greeving process. Any donation is greatl appreciated.     -Thank you¬†   Solo lo mejor para las puertas del cielo  Cuando perdemos a un ser querido, nos queramos con el ¬øpor qu√©? As√≠ como lo habr√≠a, podr√≠a o deber√≠a haber echo. Uno puede sentirse aliviado al saber que nuestros queridos difuntos est√°n con el se√±or y otros que han fallecido y que quiz√°s est√©n all√≠ para saludarlos. Sin embargo, hay una paz especial que viene con la noci√≥n de que el Se√±or solo toma lo mejor primero. ¬†A veces puede ser verdad y otras solo vemos lo mejor, porque esos buenos recuerdos son lo que mantiene a alguien vivo en nuestros corazones. Para Maria Concepci√≥n Corona, es la verdad absoluta. Una matriarca en su familia,¬†tiene¬†4 hijos, 12 nietos y 3 bisnietos.  El s√°bado por la ma√±ana, 12 de enero de 2019, Concha, como la llamaban sus familiares y amigos, perdi√≥ la vida y todo lo que la representaba a ella y su memoria en un tr√°gico incendio en su casa.  Nos estamos acercando a cualquier persona que pueda ayudar a la familia no solo con los gastos del funeral, sino a su esposo y su hijo menor, quienes lograron salir del fuego, solo para encontrarse ansiosamente haciendo intentos peligrosos, para volver a entrar a la casa para salvar ¬†querida he‚Äôs posa y mama. El fuego era tan abrumados por fuera como por dentro. ¬†No lo pudieron a lograr.¬†  Mario y Michael Corona solo desean recuperar a Concha, pero humildemente preguntamos si alguien tiene ropa, ropa interior, zapatos, calcetines, chaquetas usadas o nuevas para donar, que se comunique con la persona responsable de su conocimiento de la situaci√≥n o la familia directamente.¬† Anna Corona al (480) 888-5629 y Roy Corona al (919) 423-0156.   ¬øLa iron√≠a? Si bien la familia solo la quiere de vuelta, no importa el material, Concha solo pedir√≠a ayuda para cuidar a su familia.  Cuando deja una donaci√≥n, puede dejar un mensaje para la familia. Esto ayudar√° en su proceso de codicia. Cualquier donaci√≥n es muy apreciada.  ¬†-Gracias  ",

            "description": "My name is Jai Lola Corona and I'm a Transgender Mexican femme. I'm 33 years old and have suffered from gender dysphoria ever since I was 14 years old. I was always afraid of becoming who I felt inside because I live in a world that doesn't give visibility to people like me. Transgender women are constantly being harassed or killed for being different. Our current president wants to make trans people invisible by taking away our rights. We're living in a very tense gender climate.   I came out as transgender last year because I needed to live my truth. I suffer from depression and anxiety all because of gender. Unfortunately, I still have masculine features that prevent me from showing my true colors. When I'm in public spaces, I have the most anxiety about my gender and how people perceive me. Many times, I'm mistaken for a boy. These moments of anxiety are disabling and I often stay in bed fearing being misgendered in public.I've been on hormone replacement therapy for 6 months. This does not affect some features testosterone has done, so I'm stuck feeling gender dysphoria when I'm presenting femme in public.   I'm starting this campaign to fund a very life changing procedure called \"facial feminization\" as well as laser hair removal. This 10hr procedure will create softer feminine facial features, making my face recognizable feminine. The procedures are: rhinoplasty, trachea shave, brow lift, hairline lowering, brow bossing, jaw/chin contouring. These all might seem like cosmetic procedures, but this is meant to help my mental health around my gender presentation.   Many of you know I'm an independent hairstylist and have to pay rent for my chair on top of paying rent to live in my apartment. There's a 2 week recovery before I can get back to work. Part of the cost of this campaign will help me pay for my rent while I'm recovering from my surgeries.",

This year I am Kindly asking for donations to help save and rescue dogs of Puerto Rico. So if you‚Äôre thinking of buying me a coffee, taking me out for dinner, or buying me a little gift, I ask that you not. I urge you, instead, to make a donation to an angel sent from heaven to help the dogs of Puerto Rico in need. This angel is Nilsa Delgado. She is a dedicated, round the clock, rescuer. She is a police officer during the day and a guardian angel to these dogs at all times.¬†  Nilsa rescues abandoned, neglected and abused dogs. She funds their vet care and nurses them back to health with little to no donations or support. Nilsa then makes sure these dogs find their forever home either through private adoption or through shelters. This means that airfare must be also paid for.¬†  Nilsa has teamed up with various rescued throughout the USA to help homes for some of these dogs, some of these include New York Bully Crew, Almost Home Animal Rescue in NY, Lost Dog and Cat Rescue in Virginia, Blue Ridge Bull terrier Club in DE, and many more.¬†  I need your help.¬† I need you to support me in my effort to help Nilsa continue her vital work with these animals.¬† Will you help me improve the lives of countless homeless animals?¬† Will you please consider making a small donation. Lets make a difference together.  By the way if you are considering in getting a dog, Nilsa has many looking for homes, puppies, adults and seniors! I have attached a link to Nilsa‚Äôs Instagram where you may find many stories of rescued animals from running in the streets of Puerto Rico emaciated to the endless cuddles by their forever humans!¬†     Instagram: @Crayola_Lia_  You may also make a direct donation to Nilsa on:  PayPal: NilsaDelgado1120@Gmail.com  Amazon: www.Amazon.com/GP/registry/wishlist/3QU35Y5CDSFOB   Nilsa's Instagram: full of rescued dogs that need your help.

By the grace of God, she is still alive and able to move much of her body. She is currently in Cedar Crest Hospital in Allentown undergoing treatment and being monitored by the doctors as she heals. She is currently unable to talk and unable to mover her right arm. The doctors hope that these capabilities will come back in due time but they are unsure. They seem to think that she will be put in a rehab facility for quite some time following her discharge from the hospital. The road to recovery is going to be a long one and I pray that God supplies her with much strength and comfort.¬† On top of all of that, while she is in the hospital, the doctors are doing some tests to determine if she has uterine cancer. The symptoms that she is displaying are characteristic of it but there is nothing confirmed yet. I will keep you all updated as to the status of those tests.  My mother is one of the most important people in my life. She has sacrificed so much for me over the years and is one of the strongest people I know. I love her more than I can say and seeing her in this state has completely destroyed me for these past few days. My dad is struggling very much as well. We feel a huge void without her in the house. The most important thing we can ask for is prayer right now.  We are also having some pretty intense financial difficulties through this entire ordeal. My mom was the main one to take care of finances before she had her stroke and I did not realize just how far behind we were on a lot of bills. Before my mom went into the hospital, the bank was already threatening to foreclose on our house if we did not start catching up on payments. In addition, we are behind on many other bills including: electricity, water, and internet. I am working as much as I can while attending college full-time. I am applying for more part-time jobs and am hoping something comes through as well. My dad is also working but without my mom's income, it is going to be even harder to make ends meet now. We are also applying for government aid and disability for my mother but these will take time to get approved and to start coming in steadily. Anything you can give is helpful during this time of extreme difficulty for my family. Even if you can't give anything, I would very much appreciate sharing of the campaign and more than anything prayers. No matter what happens, I know God will provide for us and I trust Him to work everything out in the best way possible. Thank you to everyone who has already prayed, gave support, or even just listened while I break down. I cannot express how grateful I am for all of the friends and family I have during one of the hardest times in my life.",

            "description": "There is nothing more important than friendship. When I began my journey at Corona Del Mar High school it was difficult to find great friends who would be with me for the following four years. High school is tough.  But, these high school trials and tribulations are even more prevalent in individuals with an intellectual, developmental, or physical disability. Through our Best Buddies High school Friendship Program, we form one to one relationships that can help students with or without a disability make friendships to last a lifetime.   As I soon leave Best Buddies and High school behind with my many amazing friends by my side, I have a favor to ask of our community, friends, and family.   In order for our Club Chapter to continue under the Best Buddies organization we need to raise at least $500. This cost helps us to continue to be covered by all the resources the international organization offers, allows us to pay for activities and games for our meetings, and allows us to continue forming friendships at Corona Del Mar High School.   Any donation or other Newport Beach community partnerships would be extremely appreciated in helping us reach this goal!   Thank you!  Grace Dearmin  Corona Del Mar Best Buddies President",

            "description": "Brandy Lino-Corona ¬† ¬† ¬†  On September 20th of 2018, driving back from my Rowan University I fell down a small hill near the blueberry farm in Hamilton Township. I thank God I only suffered a couple of bruises and a huge headache. It was truly a miracle I was able to climb out the car with no major injuries. At that moment the only thing I wanted to do was call my dad. The lady who helped me get out the vehicle lend me her cell phone. I did not know that making that one phone call would change our lives completely. While I was being taken to the hospital, I overheard on the ambulance radio that there were multiple collisions with people in critical condition near the location where my accident occurred. It never crossed my mind that my sister and father were involved in that accident. I found out hours later when my uncle arrived at the ER. My father and I made it out from our accidents with no major injuries, but my sister Brandy was hit the hardest during the impact. She suffered a severe traumatic brain injury. She was fighting for her life in the ICU. Brandy had to get multiple surgeries due to her brain constantly swelling. She is now considered a stable patient at an inpatient rehabilitation hospital. My sister who just turned sixteen in August and I share a wonderful sibling relationship. She is my best friend and my sunshine. Watching her in the condition she is in upsets everyone who knows her because there is not one day you do not see her with a big smile on her face, laughing and making jokes. We would always go for ice coffee runs and sing every day at home. We had made plans to visit her dream school, travel for winter break, go to prom, train for softball and so much more. The last thing I told her before leaving that morning was that I loved her and the last thing she texted me minutes before their accident was, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be scared. I love you..‚Äù My family and I have been trying to raise money to help my parents and sister with any expenses they have to make. Even though you don‚Äôt know my sister, I promise you that you would love to be around her. This will be a long journey for us but as a family, we are taking it day by day. Thank you for your support.",

            "description": "Hello everyone, we started to love our kittens since the first day we saw them behind the glass wall of Petsmart. At the time they were only 5 months old, and even if we only wanted 1 kitten, we could not separate a brother from a sister, so we decided to take responsibility for the both of them. We named them  Hiro , the male and shy one, and  Brago , the female and playful one.¬†  We started to notice that these kittens had chronic diarrhea and puke, although we went numerous times to different vets they always said that they were healthy and since they are kitten it was normal and it would go away with time. We tried different medications, all of them very expensive, and we couldn't get insurance because they were sick from day 1. We tried contacting the place where we got them from, but they didnt help us, instead they blamed it in the rescue company they got the kittens from. We also called them, but again they blame it on somebody else. Nobody helped us, financially and emotionally.  Finally, after a couple of months, we saved some money and decided to do a more serious and complete check up. That's when we discovered that they both had 3 different rate viruses: - tritrichomonas foetus/blagburni¬†   -feline coronavirus   -C. Perfringens alpha toxin¬†   The vet himself couldn't believe it, and told us he has never seen all these disease in one cat at the same time. The feline coronavirus is a  very serious desease,  to explain in human terms it can be compared to cancer. The other 2 illness are rare and treatments are expensive.¬†  Unfortunately, we do not have the finances to support them, but we do love our kittens so much, they always sparkle our days. We want to give them justice, they haven't even been an year old yet, we want them to be healthy and to live a long happy life. They did not deserve the way they were treated from these institutions (which I will not name because we are tired of all the fights through phones and emails).¬†  Any sort of help will make a difference. I will thank each and every one of you till my days for your contribution. Thank you for taking time out of your day to read this. Let's fight this together for Hiro and Brago, who cant defend and speak for themselves, and so we'll do it.   ",

They currently reside in Cazadero and are in desperate need of a reliable automobile. Their one reliable car was totaled in the recent floods of February 2019. Their home was damaged but remains liveable.  They have been experiencing some challenges in the past couple of years. They moved up from Hawaii to care for Lynette‚Äôs father.   The father lived in one of the Mobile Home Parks which burned in the Tubbs fire. He made it out but suffered major trauma and hardship. Sadly, he passed not long after.   Lynette was recently laid off due to the company being sold after relocating from Santa Rosa to Cazadero.  Lynette and Chris are a hardworking and loving couple, wonderful parents to Kiana who is in High School. They have so much aloha for the people they meet. We met several years ago at an event our Santa Rosa Junior College Hawaii Community Organization hosted. We have been friends ever since.  A donation of any amount would be greatly appreciated by me and the Sumalpong  ªOhana. They will have direct access to any and all funds.

Recently, I was fortunate enough to be accepted at an early college program for high school students, Animal Science Sustainable Animal Husbandry at Cornell University. I have been dreaming to get into a program like this and I would never in a million years thought that I would be able to do it. However, they loved my application and due to my grades and all my accomplishments at school¬† I was accepted.¬† The program will give me an opportunity to have 3 college credits from an IVY league university and to obtain an incredible experience for my future. Moreover, I will be able to give back to my community by using my new knowledge to help farms around our town.¬†  However, in order for me to participate of the program I have to pay a fee of $6,500 that will cover the college credits, materials, room and meals for the entire program. I was able to reach out to Cornell University and because they really see a potential in me they awarded me with a $1,300 scholarship. They couldn't give me more because they have other students to help too. Therefore, I am reaching out to all my friends, family and community to request for donations that will help me be able to cover the rest of the cost.¬†  This is a once in a lifetime opportunity and anything you can donate will help.¬†  Thanks in advance for your help!",

Everything seems to be failing all at one time. I work but its not enough to make ends meet. I'm looking for another job right now. My husband just had surgery he has been out of work. Without his income we don't know how we are going to be able to pay our rent and utilities. Please any kind of donations will help so much. I'm also trying to raise money for my son graduation and college. This is something that I have to make great for him. My son has been on honors roll in school for years and he's graduating this year. He's worked really hard in school and he does volunteer work¬† all the time. Im very proud of him. He's a good boy. And he deserves to have everything for graduation. But right now Im struggling to make ends meet. A little help can go a long way. Every dollar helps. ¬†Its hard for me to ask for help. I never want anyone to look down on me. Or to be embarrassed of me for asking for some help. But what would you do if all you do is cry and feel hopeless because your struggling¬† to make ends meet. I never thought that I would have to ask for help like this, but I do. I would really appreciate any help. A little can go a long way. Thank you to everyone that helps.

Los Altos Youth Softball 10U Girls were invited to play in the Babe Ruth Softball World Series in Florida. ¬†A try out was open to all girls in the 10U age group and our Violet was one who made the cut. This will be a chance of a lifetime for these girls.   This tournament lasts 10 days (July 25-August 3). ¬†The players will have conditioning, workouts, friendlies, and ¬†games. With some time for a little sightseeing in between.   Costs involved:  Unfortunately the league does not cover the cost for the girls to go. They do help provide a uniform, everything else is the girls/families responsibility.   Violet has to pay for round trip air fare ($1200), hotel for 10 days ($1500) car rental for 10 days ($600). ¬†(This is for her and Jeannie)  Why give?  Violet has grown up to be quite an athlete and has ¬†enjoyed learning softball for over 6 years (of course in addition to player soccer) She loves the game and is excited at the chance to represent Los Altos girls 10U.   This opportunity to travel to Florida with a group of her teammates would increase her knowledge of the sport and help grow relationships with her teammates who share her interests.¬†  Her awesome parents are going to help her out with this trip and Violet is also doing additional fundraising however, there's no way they can foot the whole thing. ¬†  Friends and family had asked if Vi had her own page so we decided why not?  Your support would mean the world to Violet and make a softball dream come true! ¬†xo",

I am starting a \"GoFundMe\" page to help her during this time of need. My mother was admitted to the hospital on Tuesday, April 30th, 2019 after enduring bouts of severe abdominal pain and fever. Upon admission, they gathered lab work, she underwent a pelvic ultrasound, a CT scan, and further examinations. The physicians at Banner Hospital were able to identify a ruptured cyst on her left ovary, a tubo-ovarian abscess of her left fallopian tube and further infection that had spread to her organs. They tried multiple strong antibiotics and a drain to help the infection, this failed to improve her condition. On Wednesday, May 1st, momma underwent surgery and had her left fallopian tube, left ovary and appendix removed. As I write this on the 5th of May, my mother remains in critical condition. The doctors suspect the infection is widespread and she will most likely need additional surgery. I plead that you all help us in our time of need. My mother and father, the breadwinners, are currently not working due to the nature of my mother's situation. Me, their eldest daughter, I am currently recovering from a recent Rottweiler attack to the face and my youngest sister is currently recovering from right hip surgery. We have had quite a tough few weeks. We just need the support of our friends, family and our community to get through this. My mother does have medical insurance, unfortunately, she has quite a large deductible. If we can raise this money, we would be able to cover her medical expenses and their lost wages for this week. We hope she will recover soon and I will update the page to keep you all posted. Thank you in advance for all of your help. All donations matter and are greatly appreciated.    We are a strong family unit and we just want to get past this and be able to return to our lives as normal.¬†  -Brenda Corona       ",

It took him a while, but I‚Äôm so very proud to see the man he has become.  We all know the path he took and the mistakes he made. I was so heartbroken that I had to let go. It was the single, most difficult decision I ever had to make in my life to walk away and let fate decide his future.  I can thankfully say today, three years later, that Shane has become the son that I can be proud of. He has held a steady job for the past three years and has led a clean and sober life. Every time I see him, the tears well up in my eyes at my pride in this young man.  The reason I‚Äôm writing this is that Shane is planning on getting married this July 22. It is not going to be an extravagant wedding, it will be held in the backyard of a family member, in the afternoon, after he‚Äôs done working.  It pains me that I‚Äôm not financially able to help out. I would so like to make this a special occasion for him. So, hat in hand, I‚Äôm beseeching friends and family to help out, whatever you can afford, be it one dollar, or some sort of decoration or such thing. I‚Äôm trying to do an island wedding and am working with what little funds I have.  I am doing a fundraising and the link is listed below.

            "description": "To all our loved ones,   On May 13th, surrounded by love and care, Janina took her last breath on earth and her first in eternity. She battled 10 years of Huntington‚Äôs Disease which attacked her brain and nervous system. Although we are sad to say goodbye, we know she is no longer suffering and is in the presence of her Heavenly Father. She leaves behind two sons, her oldest being Johnny (19 years old) and her youngest ¬†Joshua (8 years old). Janina valued family and most of all: faith. Through her long trial she had so much joy and peace, knowing who was carrying her. She never failed to bring laughter, love and life to others. She hugged you, even if you were a stranger, because she knew the importance of love. She would joke with you, always remembering her purple Cadillac and was always down to earth. Janina was given grace, was grateful, and therefore graceful.   As we put together a day to celebrate who God shaped Janina to be, from beginning to the end of her life, please support us with whatever you can. Donations will also be going to her two sons who will continue to be supported by our friends and family.",

            "description": "Hello, This is Richies story, he was born 7 weeks early. Mom went through California testing and everything seemed good with baby and no reason to worry besides a little fluid in his kidneys. Mom was monitored weekly and the issue seemed to be resolving itself.  When Richie was prematurely born, they told us the issue was still there along with 3 other defects. Since our baby had so many issues all together at once, they called in a geneticist and took blood samples. We were interrogated and asked a series of questions, after 3 weeks of emotional torture finally they had a result for us. The doctors said Richie has a very rare syndrome with only 300 cases reported in the world. By definition individuals with this rare syndrome have difficulty eating, so automatically all efforts to teach my premature baby to eat by the nurses were diminished. They put a tube in his nose and my son was barely given a chance. Doctors insisted that we would have to leave the NICU with a Gtube in order to successfully feed Richie.  After weeks of arguing with rude nurses and being there for our son, we proved to them that he didn‚Äôt need a tube in his stomach. We spent 7 weeks in an understaffed hospital with no bedside manner and gossipy nurses. They fed my baby cold breast milk and they also relied heavily on sugar water packets to calm down babies. It was a horrible experience and now my baby is suffering from all of it on top of the syndrome. He was repeatedly pricked on the hands and feet, he was around nurses and doctors who lost hope in him but he will prevail.  I know Richie will move mountains and I will help him along the way. I want to be able to get Richie the best help possible but my insurance unfortunately does not cover the physical therapy my son requires for his age along with other services he needs. We visit several specialists, he has started treatment for his surgery, we have several copays and medications and as much as I would like to be able to cover this myself it has become a little bit hard. We need help for Richies pediatric therapies and surgery but above all we need your prayers for our little boy. Thank you for time and support, any help we receive is greatly appreciated.",

            "description": "\r\n    \r\n \r\n\r\n  UPDATE: \r\n \r\n\r\n Yesterday I went to get Corona a check up at the oncologist, unfortunately I was given bad news...\r\n \r\n\r\n Coronas cancer has come back and progressed. Its been approximately 6.5 months post operation, and the news feels worse than the first time around...¬†\r\n \r\n\r\n After shaving her stomach (after all her hair finally grew back from the operation site), we found a large 5 cm growth on the lower part of her abdomen.\r\n \r\n\r\n I dont know what I should do next, the oncologist recommends that I switch to IV form of chemo (I have been doing oral for the last few months). However, this change of treatment comes with a much higher price tag. If you could, I hope you would consider donating even a little to help me cover the costs of changing over to the new treatment plan (per session it costs approximately $900). The oncologists believes that if we do this, there will be a great chance of slowing down or reducing the size of the cancer, and stopping its spread.¬†\r\n \r\n\r\n I hope you will considering helping support Corona through her battle with her transitional cell carcinoma cancer.¬†\r\n \r\n\r\n I thought that if the cancer came back that this time around it would be easier to face and deal with, but after so many months of feeling 'in the clear' (regardless of the complications that presented like kidney infections, troublesome UTI complications, etc) its hard to come to terms that I'll see her suffer and watch her health degrade aagain...¬†\r\n \r\n\r\n ¬†\r\n \r\n\r\n Thank you all for your continued support.    \r\n \r\n\r\n ¬†\r\n \r\n\r\n  __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________  ¬†  \r\n \r\n\r\n  This is Corona, she is the love of my life.¬† \r\n \r\n\r\n Corona is a 7-year-old¬†Chow Chow. She was diagnosed two weeks ago with¬† Transitional cell¬†carcinoma , which is a  bladder cancer . When I first heard of her diagnosis, my heart dropped. In my eyes, she was the healthiest dog in the world.   I wasn't¬†very optimistic at the time because after doing some reading online, I learned that this cancer is very aggressive and animals generally do not live very long... All vets I saw were convinced the tumor had diffused throughout the entire bladder, meaning it was one of the bad cases.\r\n \r\n\r\n  Some GOOD NEWS  was given to me yesterday! After running some more tests, it turns out that what the doctors had thought, was not the case. Her tumor was in the \"good area\" and had not been diffused and is not located by the urethra.  Her tumor is in an area that makes surgery and removing possible!   However, my¬†oncologist said I have to move quickly and have the surgery within the next 2 weeks before the cancer¬†starts spreading to other organs, and her kidneys look like they'll be the next place it will spread to.¬†   This surgery is more complicated than other tumor removing surgeries because of the location within the bladder. The surgery alone is estimated to be within $4,000-$5,000 and chemotherapy is a must for after the surgery because of the aggressive nature of this type of cancer. Chemotherapy ends up being about $700 every 3 weeks.¬†\r\n \r\n\r\n I have come to GoFundMe in hopes that Corona will be able to have enough money to get her surgery. If I'm able to generate even a little funds to help me cover the bill, it will help me pick the best course of action for my girl.¬† The funds generated from this campaign would go towards Corona's tumor-removing surgery and chemotherapy treatments.¬†The doctors think Corona has a chance to beat this cancer, a chance that most dogs with this cancer don't¬†have!¬†\r\n \r\n\r\n Being a student has made it hard for me to cover all the costs associated with getting her the care she needs. Up until this point I've spent over $5,000 on costs incurred along the way to this diagnosis. The doctors initially thought she had a stubborn UTI. She was treated for 3 months, then they thought she had bladder stones (costing me $1,200 in surgery) to then find out it was cancer :( During this time, due to extreme discomfort she was experiencing, she broke her canine teeth biting at the wall, which resulted in having to do emergency dental work   getting root canals costing another $3,000 on top of the treatments and tests for what they thought was a UTI. Currently, I am extremely financially strained but I really want to do everything I can to make sure Corona will recover! She means so much to me and I made a commitment to her when I rescued her!  If you can help in ANY WAY it would mean so much to both of us! \r\n \r\n\r\n If you don't know Corona, I want to share with you her story (well, Corona and I's love story).¬† My mother and I rescued Corona from a farm in Wisconsin, she had been chained up outside and left with a very little amount of food during the winter months. Luckily she's a chow chow and has a warm coat.¬†\r\n \r\n\r\n When we first met Corona she was WILD, she had become a scavenger and eating all the local's farm animals. Even though she was like this, the moment she and I met, we had a bond. She came right up to me and sat at my feet. I had never once in my life had an animal react to me like this before, the pets my family had growing up usually favorited someone else in my family. She didn't bark or growl at me as she did to the other people around.  That's when I knew I found the love of my life. ¬†\r\n \r\n\r\n It's been about 5 years since we first met,  she's gone from living wild on a farm in Wisconsin to moving to Canada and being a city girl in Montreal . There's no other way I can describe our relationship other than what I've said previously, that she's the love of my life and I believe¬†I am that to her as well.¬†  If you are able to help me out in any way (even with just advice or your experience if you've had a dog go through this cancer), any contribution is greatly appreciated!¬†¬†  If you are or have gone through cancer with a pet, I am so sorry. It's such a hard and confusing thing to go through.     Corona and her friend Sabrina! \r\n ",

            "description": " Seeds For Future Memories: Make It Rain $60k!   #60KforCentro ¬†#MonstritxsALaObra   Right now is a crucial moment for Centro Corona, and we are calling on our people to support us in meeting our fundraising goal of $60,000 by June 20th, the minimum amount needed to cover our rent and the maintenance of our building for the full year. Centro Corona is a community center with a long history since 2011 in Corona, Queens, an intergenerational space that builds from the experience, leadership, and knowledge of working-class and immigrant communities to build a self-determined, collectively-imagined future. In late 2018, unexpectedly we lost our first home base for eight years. In December 2018 we were able to relocate to a lovely new building that is quickly becoming home. Our monthly rent jumped from $1800 a month to $3800, and we need your support to keep our space.   Share our fundraiser and encourage your folks to donate something. Doesn‚Äôt matter the amount, as long as they donate.  ‚òÜ YOU CAN READ MORE ABOUT THIS CAMPAIGN AND OUR WORK BELOW ‚òÜ  ***  Seeds For Future Memories: Make It Rain $60k!   #60KforCentro ¬†#MonstritxsALaObra   Frequencies. Transmissions.  They said ‚Äúancestors, listen.‚Äù, and they were talking to us. Lighting candles. ‚ÄòTaita, Mama, we are your wildest dream‚Äô we heard them say. They spoke with lights. ‚ÄúWe have abandoned cages. No borders, the land is back in our hands, breathing. The people are resting, and allowed.‚Äù  Affirmations. We are building the path, and bringing them into existence. We feel it, resonating within our bones.  Affirmations. We are sowing them. Into existence.  Frequencies. Transmissions. Messages from a liberated future.   Do you feel these messages too?  We are calling on our people who felt it and have witnessed it. Who witnessed how sharing a space, groundless and precarious, can begin to be enough for conversations to happen, for answers to arrive, and for future memories to foment. If you felt them too, then you have witnessed what can happen when people share a place with purpose. When we are in community with each other, we begin to take things back. We begin to give to each other. We create, lead, and defend. We transform ways of justice and solidarity that can be replicated in more homes, in more neighborhoods. We sow seeds for a liberated future. Our descendents are speaking to us, and we are listening.  If you heard these messages too, we are calling on your help now, to build and sustain Centro Corona for the long haul, autonomously. The work that we do often does not align with funding mandates. This does not concern us. We know that to continue our work, we must rely on the people who love Centro the most, who will feel these transmissions from the future and recognize their own voices, just as they imagined they could be.    Where are they coming from?  We believe they are coming from Corona, many generations from now. The voices of our children‚Äôs grandchildren, who are now leading the healing, and sustaining the earth. Perhaps, in this very same building.  The messages are from those who have carried on the work that is already happening today. Our community-led work from the past 8 years: education justice, homework help and la Monstrita Justiciera; gender justice and Soy Yo: Sex Ed Camp for Families; community defense and political theater production ‚ÄúPor la Justicia y los Sorbetes.‚Äù Our work that centers key practices and methodologies using arts and culture, popular education, accompaniment, generational leadership development, and creates intergenerational and bilingual spaces for collective decision and art-making. The messages are from futures we have begun growing, from seeds that have already been planted, and we must continue to grow fiercely.     Why are we receiving them now?  This is a crucial moment for Centro. In late 2018, we lost the space that made so much of this work possible. With immense challenge, in December we were able to relocate to a lovely new building that is quickly becoming home. Yet we are met with the realities of how the land is treated as a commodity, as our monthly rent jumped from $1800 a month to $3800, with a $7,200 deposit on our new lease. Our neighborhood is being gentrified, and the people and places that make our community beautiful are being forced out. Today, we are about to sign a lease to remain in our neighborhood, and soon to become an independent organization. However, as we stand right now, we do not have the funds to stay past 3 or 4 months. ¬†  At Centro Corona we have made a community where lives of creativity and independence can be lived with joy. For eight years we have confronted the cultural and economic oppression facing working-class and immigrant communities. For eight years we have created safe spaces within our neighborhoods for people to rehearse a liberated future. We have turned violence into art, education, activism and, over time, slowly yet crucially, liberation. ¬†  We are made to believe that our future is uncertain, but we heard them speak to us. We feel new frequencies resonating inside us. They are transmissions from our liberated future, sometimes vivid, and sometimes faded, never gone, but never complete, the voices strange, yet familiar. They have never been stronger than they are now. It is up to us to make them true.    How do we honor them?  We accept their messages, and believe they are real. We accept their affirmations that we are working towards freedom, so we start sowing freedom now. Our struggles now bring great opportunity to stabilize Centro, in this place, as a permanent part of our future.  We decided on a raising goal of $60,000, because it is the minimum amount needed for rent and maintenance of our building for the next year. We chose to do this large amount via people‚Äôs fundraising, because it will support our agency to continue to create spaces of collective decision-making and action-taking with autonomy. We are committed to maintaining a space that is free and accessible by and for our people.  If you witnessed and believe in this future, help us materialize all this into reality now, by supporting this people-organized campaign. We have taught each other how to get to this point, and have had lots of community advice and support. We hold no degrees on fundraising, but we hold a trust in our people who will helps us get there!   We need your support! Email your friends, make sure they donate something. Anything, as long as they donate. Share widely. Ask us about how to become a monthly sustainer. Ask us about one-time large donations. Share knowledge with us. Support our self-taught processes, all very DIC type of work (Do it in Community). Invest in our future memories!   ###  Centro Corona is an intergenerational community center that builds from the experience, leadership, and knowledge of working-class and immigrant communities from Corona and nearby Queens neighborhoods to build a self-determined, collectively-imagined future. We see our community organizing work as a living, ongoing process of building leadership and re-imagining what organizing could be: deeply intimate, emergent, organic and relational organizing grounded in arts and culture.

Hace 9 a√±os fui diagnosticada por primera vez con cancer de seno, pase por quimioterapia, ¬†radioterapia y mastectomia radical de mama; ahora me encuentro con la sorpresa de que nuevamente se encuentra en mi cuerpo cancer pero ahora en el pulmon. Sinceramente y con el corazon en la mano no pregunto a Dios, porque? Sino para que? Que se me esta olvidando aprender? Que estoy dejando de hacer? Pues solo quiero ver crecer a mis hijos y poder ver envejecer a mis padres y ayudarles en esa etapa de su vida acaso es mucho pedir, no quiero dinero, lujos, joyas no, solo quiero tiempo, solo tiempo Dios.Pues cada dia que amanece lucho, amo, admiro y suspiro por un poco de salud para poder hacer y tener sue√±os para poder vivir para alcanzarlos, cada dia abrazo la vida como los arboles extienden sus ramas tratando de alcanzar el sol, solo tengo ¬†esperanza y fe de poder lograrlo pero creo que mis fuerzas no me van alcanzar. No estoy derrotada estoy mas viva que nunca y el cancer me ha ense√±ado que las cosas y sucesos malos tambien tienen cosas buenas y ense√±anzas de vida. Me falta mucho como a todos por lograr pero primero Dios y solo el sabra. Les doy infinitas gracias por su apoyo y pido mil bendiciones que dios les de mas y les multiplique. Attentamente Su amiga Ayde  Hello my name is Ayde and I am 42 years old. I am a mother of 2 amazing kids and part of a loving family of 3 sisters. 9 years ago I was diagnosed with breast cancer for the first time. I went through all available treatments like chemo and a full mastectomy. Now, I find myself in this situation again but this time the cancer has developed in my lungs.¬†  I sincerely and and with all the pain in heart ask God why? Why me again? What do I need to learn? What am I doing wrong? I just want to serve you and watch my kids grow up, is this too much to ask for? I don't need money or luxuries I just want time.¬† Every day when I wake up I fight, I love and I pray for health to live and reach my dreams of being with my kids, to hug, kiss and hear them laugh. I just want the opportunity to do so, I will fight and endure what is necessary to beat this disease.¬† My doctors are not giving me much hope and tell me that the process is very costly and painful but I refuse to give up hope.¬†I have not¬† given up and I am more determined then ever to survive. If there is one thing I have learned that for every bad thing that happens something good comes and there is always something to learn from the experience. I put my faith in God and I will not lose hope until my last breath. I thank you in advance and ask God bless you for your attention and any help you can give! My family and I will always be in your debt and you will be in our prayers. Sincerely, Ayde.",

            "description": "AJ was a son, a brother, a friend, a nephew, a grandson, a good man, a hard worker, a family man, an all around good person. AJ was the type of person who would always make you smile, would be there for you on your darkest day. AJ was a person you could always count on and who loved his family and would give you the shirt off his back if you needed it.  On July 7th 2019 AJ was in a fatal car accident. One that ended his young life far too short.¬†¬†  This go fund me is to raise the funds needed to properly honour and commemorate AJ. The life he lived and all the lives he touched with his kind heart. Anything you can donate for AJ's funeral is greatly appreciated.  All funds will be directed to Angela Companioni Chirono for funeral/memorial expenses. Mother of Adan Jose Corona. We thank you for your donations and sharing this GoFundMe with your friends and family.  Rest in peace Adan Jose Corona.",

            "description": "In May of this year, Judy Corona was diagnosed with CUP ‚Äì Cancer of Unknown Primary. This is a rare condition in which cancer cells are found in the body but, the place of the cancer began is not known. The Primary Cancer can spread to other parts of the body. This type of cancer is terminal. At the time of her diagnosis, she was informed that the cancer had spread to Pancreas, Liver, Stomach and Hip.   Unfortunately, there is no specific treatment that can treat this type of Cancer. Since her diagnose, she has been hospitalizing several time for various medical conditions. Recently, Judy was re-admitted due to stroke (brain) and is under observation.  With this medical condition, Judy had to discontinue her work and is now bed-ridden. This condition has forced Judy to be provided with a Nurse by her at all times. Those of you that know Judy, she is a strong woman but she is now in the fight of her life. She has such a positive attitude even with the diagnosis she faces. Please keep her in your prayers.  Judy does have immediate family to take care of her; however, she is fighting this battle all by herself and needs support from friends and family. That alone is difficult, but this will also create a financial hardship. I am hoping that we can provide a little support by trying to get her a private care and help her with the medical expenses that are not covered. With Judy‚Äôs determination and our help, we should be able to kicking cancer's butt and getting her healthy again.  The money will go directly to Judy to help with her medical expenses and basic needs as she is no longer working. Please consider donating if you are able to, every bit helps.  We thank you in advance for your donation. Your thoughts, prayers and donations are truly appreciated.",

It‚Äôs difficult to have to think of a new life without a mom, sister, daughter, friend, etc. She was a loving, caring, crazy, but compassionate person and she will be missed by many. My mom had a voice of her own and she was never scared to use it. Our hearts are shattered. Last month, my family and I lost our grandma so with the loss of my mom being so unexpected, my family and I are struggling to find the funds to give her the service she deserves.

            "description": "Hello Family, Friends, and Supporters,  My name is Christina Corona. This upcoming 2019-2020 school year I will be a Senior at Vintage High School. It will also be my 4th year on the Vintage High School Cheer and Dance Team. While at Vintage High School I have managed to be apart of the Cheer and Dance Team, keep a 4.0 G.P.A, and participate in numerous school activities.   This¬†past weekend my team and I were fortunate enough to attend a 3 day NDA dance camp in Rocklin, CA. At camp I was nominated and selected to be on the All-American team. With this selection I was also invited to perform in a New years day parade in Rome, Italy! I am more than grateful to have been given this opportunity and would love to be able to attend.¬†  Since I was little girl I have always loved to dance. It all started when I was 5 years old dancing tap at Pepperettes Baton and Dance Club. This sparked a fire in me, a passion. Tap drew to me joining a Ballet Folklorico dance club at my elementary school, Napa Valley Language Academy. I was involved in the dance club from Kindergarten all the way to the Fifth grade and I can definitely say It kept my feet moving. I would have practices after school and perform at different school events. This only made my passion for dance grow stronger. ¬†After dancing for a few years, I decided to try my luck with gymnastics at The Gymnastic Zone in Napa. And let me say, this changed everything for me. I realized I not only wanted to dance but I also wanted to have gymnastics play a role in the way I danced.   My mom finally realized how much I enjoyed dancing and gymnastics and decided to look into cheerleading. She signed me up to join The Napa Raiders Football and Cheer Youth Club, and this is the best thing my mom has ever done for me. I will admit at first I was quite nervous, I had never done cheerleading or even tried to mix both dancing and gymnastics. But after practicing everyday after school, having games on Saturdays in the scorching sun and competing on a stage in front of hundreds of people, I realized I had fallen in love with the sport of cheerleading. I continued this journey with being apart of The Napa Bears and The Napa Valley Jets cheer teams. In total I was apart of youth cheerleading for 5-6 years and knew for a fact I wanted to continue this passion in high school.¬†  I had always looked at the Vintage Cheer and Dance team as a dream. I knew one day I would be given the chance to try-out but didn't have much confidence in myself. ¬†When my freshman year finally rolled around I was overwhelmed with jitters and excitement. I stepped into the try-out barely knowing anyone or what to expect. I gave it my everything on all 3 days of try-outs. On the last day we were to find out who was going to make the team. I can still remember all the emotions of knowing wether or not I had a chance. My phone had rigged later that day, that the coaches had just posted the list of the 2016-2017 team. ¬†I opened the page to see my name! I was beyond happy that my dream of being on this team was finally coming true. Since then I have loved my experience. This team has opened many doors for me, taught me many things and helped me create lifelong friendships. ¬† This trip to Rome is something I could have never imagined to be offered to me and it is a once in a lifetime opportunity. With that said, it also carries a large cost to attend. Which is why I am reaching out to everyone I can for the help. I love what I am doing with cheerleading and dance and would be more than fortunate to be able to represent not only my team but my town outside of the U.S. .  Thank you to anyone and everyone who donates, I am so appreciative for everything I am given and hope to snap a couple selfies in the historic streets of Rome, Italy!  XOXO, Christina Corona",

Our passion for the environment and farming has led us to establish Farming for Abundance, an initiative whose mission is¬†to accelerate the transition towards regenerative agroforestry. We believe we can heal the earth through smart ecological farming practices.  In 2015, we started Abundance Farm in Raglan, Victoria, Australia. We are in the process of turning 97 acres of weathered sheep pasture into a diverse, chemical free and regenerative farm using agroforestry and mixed animal systems. This has been the biggest adventure of our lives.   Kali and Alex storing hay for the cows, with the help of Shanti and the cheeky chooks (Photo by Beatriz Corona)  ¬†   What we've accomplished in the past three and a half years   So far, we have fenced and planted a forest along the creeks and boundary areas. We also removed old fencing that was a risk of injury to wildlife.  With volunteers and friends‚Äô help, we planted 3500 native trees and shrubs that will provide wildlife refuge, improve the waterways and reverse erosion. ¬† Alex and Kali planting trees in 2016   We are grazing a small flock of laying hens on pasture. They live in mobile houses with lots of space to roam.   They eat vegetables that were rejected due to their shape or colour. By diverting them from landfill, we avoid the methane pollution it would create. We also cook and ferment grains, herbs, spices and minerals to keep our hens healthy and happy so they can provide people with delicious and healthy eggs.   The chooks upcycling unwanted pumpkins (Photo by Alejandro Corona)   We started grazing a small herd of Angus cattle as well, which we move regularly with the principles of rotational grazing. The cows eat the tall grass promoting the growth of fresh green grass for the hens, as well as providing them with fresh and yummy cow patties that the hens scratch and spread looking for insects, mycelium and undigested grass seeds‚Ä¶  We have recently started providing beef that is ethical and regenerative as an alternative for conscious omnivores.  Our rotational grazing mixed animal system helps maintain the pastures and forest healthy by cycling organic matter which feeds the soil micro-organisms and sequesters carbon. ¬† Our complementary animal system:¬†cows and chickens roaming the land¬† (Photo¬† by Marianne Khol)  ¬† We have been working on drought proofing the farm as much as possible by investing in small dams, rain water tanks and pipes that reach the whole farm.  We have also applied regenerative earthworks that increase water infiltration in the soil and stop erosion.   One of the little dams that we built as part of our orchard system,¬† enjoyed by farm and wild animals alike. (Photo by Kali)  ¬† We have planted an apple orchard that is maintained and fertilised by geese and ducks. We wish to extend the orchard throughout the farm with various other fruit trees to provide people with healthy fruit from many rare heritage varieties.   We've planted more than 80 apple trees from 18 heritage varieties (Photo by Kali)   And we are just getting started‚Ä¶     The next step   We are currently building facilities comprised of two shipping containers and a shed which will allow us to wash and pack eggs, fruits and vegetables and store them with refrigeration.  The shed will help us more efficiently organise the farm resources and divert valuable food waste from landfill. The facilities will provide a space that can serve as a resource hub and empower other farmers in the western districts of Victoria. ¬† Kali packing eggs in the 'work-in-progress' shipping container facility (Photo by Alejandro Corona) ¬†  We are planning on increasing the size of our flock of hens in a very near future, so we can provide more eggs.  We are confident that we will achieve all our goals with hard work and thoughtful planning, but with your help it would accelerate our project and allow us to have a greater impact, faster.   One of our hens enjoying her mobile home (Photo by Sofie Holt) ¬†    What we need to achieve our goals   We are asking for your help to advance our project and inspire others in our region and the rest of the world.  Here is what we need:  1. If we raise 6,000 AUD, we can afford to build our own mobile brooding facilities. Brooding our own hens will allow us to:  ¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Raise healthy chickens on pasture from the day they are born ¬∑¬† ¬† ¬† Increase our free range layer flock so we can be profitable ¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Breed heritage dual-purpose poultry  2. If we raise 30,000 AUD, we can also afford one more mobile free range house for 500 hens. This will increase our income and achieve financial viability for our project.  3. If we raise 39,500 AUD, we can also finish the farm facilities. This will allow us to:   ¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Pack and distribute farm produce and eggs more efficiently ¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Manage farm resources ¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Upcycle more food waste ¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Offer our facilities and resources to help other regenerative farms  4. If we raise 57,500 AUD, we can also afford a solar system to operate our facilities off grid and limit the use of a generator to a backup situation only.  ¬† Summary:  1. Mobile brooding house for raising 500 hens: $ 6,000  2. Mobile chicken house for 500 laying hens: $ 24,000  3. Shed roof, refrigeration and permits: $ 9,500  4. Solar panel array 7.28kv, batteries, inverter and generator: $ 18,000  Total needed: $ 57,500 ¬†   With your help we can have more happy and healthy hens roaming our land¬† (Photo by Sofie Holt)     Come have a taste of the farm   If you are a farm supporter of $150 or more, you will receive a full Abundance Farm experience with a guided tour where you will have the opportunity to meet our feathered and furry friends and learn about regenerative agriculture.

I know so many great carpenters, woodworkers, cabinet makers, plumbers, electricians, etc. I'm sure most of them got their start in middle school woodshop, metal shop, auto class. My son Lucas is currently in a robotics class at Hilltop Middle School. It's taught by Ms Young who also teaches woodshop at the school.¬† I met with her this week to discuss some tool donations from my work. In talking to her she explained that she doesn't know if she'll have enough lumber, safety glasses, ear plugs, consumables (sandpaper, drill bits, saw blades) etc. She purchases what she can out of her own pocket and relies on donations for what she can't buy on her own.¬† I thought to myself, \"I wish I could do more\" Well, alone I can't but together we can. I decided to reach out to my friends and connections to pull together and help this program. I'm not asking for a lot, a couple of bucks from a lot of people adds up quick.

            "description": "I was attacked by a dog a little under 3 months ago. The dog bit me, completely unprovoked, and tore off a portion of my top lip and my nose. I had to rush to the emergency room to reattach the lip to my face and got stitches on my nose as well.   I now need help paying for the medical bills as the owners of the dog have ignored my messages asking them to cover the medical costs. Along with stitches, I had to get a series of post-exposure rabies shots as the owner had told the doctors that the dog had all of its shots, but I soon came to find out that the dog had not been up to date on his rabies shots. Unfortunately I am not able to pursue a legal case at this time, as the owners do not have insurance.   My medical bills are slightly less than $3000 but I am hoping to get reconstructive surgery in the near future. I am not looking for sympathy, and publicly asking for money is not something I am proud of. This attack has caused me intense emotional trauma and has negatively impacted my mental health, but I am slowly coming to terms with things. I would appreciate any help you may be able to contribute, whether it be emotional, monetary, or just by simply sharing this post, and I wish you all a great day.   Thank you!",

We have found a trailer ($4250) that will allow residents to drop recycling materials at a single location 24/7, and will allow us to take these materials to the recycling facility. The trailer for sale is in another state on a for sale site from a truck company and there is major interest in it. We are putting a deposit on it to hold it for us, but they will only hold it for a few weeks and are offering to deliver the trailer to Denver CO (about 2 hrs away) for an additional $500.

I have been caring for our boys since she is not mentally stable to do so. I work full time, but cannot keep up with the bills not just to my rent, food, gas, clothing, and lawyer, but now to my own medical condition worsening. In my attempts to keep my children safe, fed, housed and well educated, I have been enduring nerve damage to my right eye and BPPV(vertigo) in the right side of my head. I am in constant pain all day. I work as a subcontractor for the navy, as I was enlisted from 2005 to 2009. I cannot get VA assistance because of my OTH discharge. I served four years but have not been able to overturn my discharge after testing positive THC. Right before I was about to be processed out my late uncle passed away and I was grieving at the time I self medicated. I was placed on restriction during a garbage disposal curtailment. The nightshift left me too tired to meet the restriction muster demands, which left me in the brig for three days with only bread and water. Ultimately I sacrificed my leave time, GI Bill, discharge of service and peace of mind. I am still in the process of getting my discharge upgraded. The VA is reluctantly helping me find housing for me and my children. As of now, I am in dire straits.",

            "description": "Warming The Streets is a project run by young adults, aiming to reach out to rough sleepers in London by providing warmth, food and conversation in an attempt to brighten up their winter.  Warming The Streets was started because of the very visible issue in the streets of London, which is homelessness.¬† The number of people seen rough sleeping in London increased by 1,371 in the past year, and is now well over 8,000 people. Figures from the Office for National Statistics show that an estimated 726 homeless people died in England and Wales in 2018. We see people struggling on the streets of London everyday and want to make a change, in whatever way we can, to make it a little less unbearable.  Warming The Streets aims to provide short term comfort to those experiencing homelessness in 3 simple and direct ways:  1) Food - Our packages will contain essential food and drink such as bottles of water, granola bars, fruit   veg, sandwiches and dog food. 2) Clothes - Our packages will contain essential warm clothing such as hats, scarves, socks, blankets and raincoats/anoraks. 3) Conversation - People experiencing homelessness are just that - people. They have the same need for interaction as anyone else; so our volunteers will aim to engage in conversation with the recipients and talk to them about anything that they deem appropriate. During this time we can also hand out optional extras such as maps to local services, tooth brushes/paste and cleansing wipes.  Our objective is to be as direct as possible. We hope to receive donations in the form of items, clothing and money and assemble our care packages. Our volunteers will deliver them straight to those experiencing homelessness.  100% of the donations will be going towards the assembling and distribution of the care packages, and with your help, we can bring a little warmth to those experiencing homelessness this winter.  Thank you so much,  Warming The Streets",

He was working with F.L.Y and the New Hope for Youth program. These programs work with at risk youth to help them turn their life around and they were helping Jose get his life back on track. He had also signed up to go back to school to get his last few credits and graduate high school. His counselors described him as self motivated, respectful, and a hard worker. He has lost his life in terrible way because he was stabbed on October, 6th, 2019 as he exited Mexico Bakery on Alum Rock. He had gone to the bakery to get some bread for his mom and was never able to return home. He was only four blocks away from his house this should have never happened to him or his family. His family needs your help for his funeral services and to be able to lay him to rest. Anything helps, god bless.",

Created 10 hours ago Community   Neighbor and BRONCO PLAYERS we don't want them getting sick Hi, I‚Äôm¬† anthony, the co-founder of lunchdebt.org. I‚Äôm a father in colorado, and I‚Äôm concerned about the impact of COVID-19 on our state and country.¬†  A few years ago, I raised money to help kids across our state by eliminating their school lunch debt. I took action because I saw a need. Collectively, I knew we could do something about it. And we did: We wiped out lunch debt in schools across the state of Washington.¬†  Today, we‚Äôre facing a bigger challenge. The coronavirus is hitting Washington hard. Unfortunately, 29 people have died and 366 people have tested positive, according to the Washington State Department of Health. Government officials warn it could reach 64,000 in a few months if our leaders do not take the steps necessary to stop the spread of the virus.¬†  We hope and encourage our government officials to do all they can to test, treat, and prevent the spread of the coronavirus.¬†  People need immediate help. During this crisis, those with the least suffer the most. Some folks can‚Äôt go to the doctor because they don‚Äôt have healthcare. Public schools are closed for at least two weeks and some people can‚Äôt afford to take off work because they don‚Äôt have paid sick leave. Some parents have to choose between paying the rent and feeding their kids.¬†  This will get worse before it gets better. But the good news is that there‚Äôs a path forward.we don't have it here in colorado this is just in case and as things are going if theres any money left over we will give it to the lunchprograms for schools¬†  You may wonder, like I have, if there‚Äôs anything we can do to help. We don‚Äôt have to sit idly by waiting for someone else to solve the problem. We can take action. We need to come together and lift up the folks that need a helping hand.¬†  ¬†Foundation‚Äôs COVID-19 Response Fund. The colorado Foundation is an important organization providing direct relief to those that need it most. They will provide money to ‚Äúresidents without health insurance and/or access to sick days, people with limited English language proficiency, healthcare and gig economy workers, and communities of color, among others.‚Äù The Fund is working closely with King County‚Äôs Pandemic Community Advisory Group to identify organizations currently providing or receiving requests for support and will use the money raised on our campaign to assist with these efforts.  I will not have access to the funds. Every dollar donated will be transferred directly to the colorado Foundation. Your donation is tax-deductible.¬†  Please join me in becoming part of the solution. Donate $5, $10, or $25 bucks. Every contribution counts.

            "description": "Family and friends, I have started this campaign for Piper because many of you have asked if there was a way to donate to help her live out her dreams with the amazing opportunities that she has been given. She is currently doing to fundraisers at school to raise money and I‚Äôm sure more fundraisers will be in the works. Many of you don‚Äôt live in Nevada and can‚Äôt actively participate in her fundraisers and have asked me if she has a go fund me or PayPal or any other way to send money to her since you can‚Äôt buy anything from her to help her out. Currently Piper is working hard at school in her last fall season with Sierra Vista HS. She got accepted into the Macy‚Äôs All American Marching Band where she will spend a week in New York rehearsing, taking leaderships classes and touring places like Radio City Hall. Now she has the opportunity to go with Sierra Vista HS to Ireland to perform, learn some Irish dancing and see sites in this amazing country. Piper is growing and learning so much in the Color Guard world and she‚Äôs not done yet!!!!! She recently got accepted into Arizona State University were she plans on continuing her Color Guard Career and studying to get a BS degree in Medical Services. Unfortunately none of this is free and that is why she is fundraising as much as possible to raise $2000 for the Macy‚Äôs Parade and $3000 for Ireland. If you can participate in her fundraisers please do so, but for those of you that don‚Äôt live in Nevada and want to help please donate and for those of you that just don‚Äôt want to buy any more candy or whatever the fundraiser may be but still want to help her please also donate here. Piper and I can‚Äôt thank you all enough for your donations and all the love and support you have shown her thoughts the years!!!!! It truly does take an entire tribe to give her these opportunities when you‚Äôre a single parent. We are truly blessed ‚ù§Ô∏è",

Gerne auch per E-Mail unter Bekanntgabe Ihrer Mail-Adresse.\r\n\r\nSollte jemand eine zu weite Anreise haben, werden wir den Gutschein auch verschicken. Hierzu bitte eine Nachricht auf Facebook oder per Mail.\r\n\r\nF√ºr alle Velberter, Bitte holen Sie den Gutschein unter Vorlage des Ausweises und der Spendenquittung bei uns ab, sobald wir das Cafe-Restaurant wieder ge√∂ffnet haben.\r\n\r\nDer Gutschein kann nur ausgegeben werden, wenn Sie bei Ihrer Spende den Namen angeben. \r\n\r\nIch danke Ihnen von ganzen Herzen und hoffe, dass wir uns bald wieder in unserem Nostalgie Cafe   Restaurant sehen. \r\n\r\nIhr Lars Jesert und das gesamte Nostalgie Cafe   Restaurant Team",

I will be flying down December 1st through the end of February and would like to help out with labor as much as I can but I need your help to make this possible for them as a gift of generosity.  For those who knew my dad while living in Oregon, know that he‚Äôs a really hard worker. For the last 8 years, he has been protecting and fighting for native family land from illegal government and family actions that have held him back from progressing.   Being on the farm means constantly feeding the animals, watering the crops, cleaning the property, and taking the kids to and from school while providing the means for food and daily necessities.         Meaning, he takes any small jobs that allow him to still work his farm schedule, for example selling a barrel of mangos for $5, a basket of eggs for $3 or cleaning reusable bags for crops.¬†     My dad has had multiple hospitalizations from scorpions since he is the one constantly working the fields. They all have to avoid the mosquitos and no seams.¬†      This room means they can end their hard working day and rest their heads in a safe, closed, and secure room.     I know without a doubt that if these illegal government and family circumstances were not holding him back, he would be in better living conditions.¬†  My dad is a very giving man and anyone who knew/know him personally would have positive things to say about him. He is constantly helping with my siblings schools by volunteering and helping them with improvements whenever he can. His pigs even have a better foundation than his current room. Also giving back to his community members when they possibility is there.¬†    During this season of gifts and giving, please consider my family. Thank you so much and bless your heart of generosity towards them!¬†     Much love,¬†  Dayana",

My husband [Eric] has been battling cancer this year while in prison and has been granted parole, so he should be home by April 2020.¬† Early in the year he had multiple seizures; triggered by his asthma, bronchitis   pneumonia. In May they went in   found a tumor  ¬† removed it from the left side of his chest. Three days after surgery he had a¬† stroke   than 2 days later surgery to remove ulcers in his throat In August they said 2 more tumors had grew on the opposite side Scheduled surgery for Oct 1, they went in and removed the larger tumor, due to the size it was removed in pieces. When they did that, they found another one hiding. Oct 4, the one hiding busted I bvb his chest,¬† he began hemorrhaging   was rushed to the hospital¬† Oct 7, the removal of the other tumor was completed Nov 1, he had another stroke Nov 16, they found 2 tumors in his brain   he was swelling up that's why he was having headaches Nov 25, he began to bleed from his nose   head was swelling, it began to turn purple Dec 1, his brain was swollen   he began to bleed from his head   nose Dec 2, Dr's did a procedure to remove fluid from his brain   release some of the pressure. The final surgery for the 2 tumors is pending at this moment.¬†  In addition;¬† I'm unable to return to work at this time.  Nov 13, I was followed home from the corner store   sexually assaulted in my home. I've completed the Crime Victim's Program forms through Texas Attorney Generals Office   awaiting approval. I am starting counseling with Houston Area Women's Center   Memorial Assistant Ministries, I also have Dr Appointments scheduled   having difficulties in crowds   around any place there are a lot of men. I cry a lot   shake uncontrollably at any given moment, it has lasted for 24 hours   so it is a challenge stepping out of the house for too long. I changed my locks but unable to rest at night, so I cat nap throughout the day.   I'm a survivor of 30 years of multiple types of abuse; including childhood sexual abuse, rape, captivity, torture, teen dating abuse   domestic violence... so I know eventually I'll get stronger but right now, I have no idea how the rent, bills or Eric's financial needs will be met .  So this request is to cover basic needs   expenses for us both at this time.¬† We aren't worried about the Holiday's as life itself is what we both are grateful for   focused on.  We thank you from the bottom of our hearts   greatly appreciate any help possible. God bless you   please keep us both in prayer for a full healing   rapid recovery.¬†  ",

The organization aims to create theatrical experiences that speak to both actors and audiences of the Millennial generation, although all generations will appreciate the generation-relevant content that the organization seeks to provide  The company has recently found its new home at the newly restored Robins Theatre in Warren, Ohio and has just launched their 2020 season. The company's next season will consist of Shrek the Musical, Heathers the Musical (5 year anniversary show), a yet-to-be-released Summer Musical, The Rocky Horror Show, and Hairspray.¬†  The goal of this campaign is to secure funds to offset expenses for a rehearsal/storage space for the company, due to the theatre being used all year long for other performances.  How Your Donation Can Help ¬†Many members of the Millennial Generation have found a difficult time getting involved in theatrical leadership roles, most of which are almost always exclusively reserved for older members of the community. The Millennial Theatre Company seeks to provide an outlet for Millennials to take on these leadership roles, while also providing audiences with theatrical experiences that reflect and speak to the generation's experiences, interests, and values. This can be evidenced in the company's mission statement; \"Producing quality theatrical experiences with, for, and of a generation\".  The Millennial Theatre Company is also hoping to extend its reach beyond the traditional staging of a musical. The company also hosts educational workshops, geared towards the Millennial Generation, to help prepare actors for the stage. Although programming is designed with Millennials in mind, individuals of all ages are welcome and encouraged to attend all Millennial Theatre Company events. The company is also working with young artists to produce locally written work, written exclusively by members of the Millennial Generation.  By having our own rehearsal space, we will be able to get many members of the Millennial Generation involved. We currently jump from spaces in Girard and Poland, but would like to have a consistent space that we can build sets, rehearse, and develop MTC year-round.¬†  Other Ways You Can Help Help us get out the word about Millennial Theatre Company.  ‚Äî Sharing our Facebook posts and Twitter announcements.  ‚Äî Sharing this campaign with friends and family.  ‚Äî Attend future Millennial Theatre Company events.  ‚ÄîPurchase season tickets.",

My underlying autoimmune disease, putting me in the COVID-19 high risk group, is called  EGPA ¬† and causes severe daily sinus and lung infections--but¬† after researching and employing an alternative treatment using ozone gas infused into water and oil, I was able to completely stop them and heal my tissues.¬† ¬†I also have progressive cardiomyopathy and COPD with lungs operating at 40%.¬† My disease ulcerates the arterial lining within organs and can make them fail and has attacked my colon, retina, middle ear (causing profound hearing loss) lungs, and heart along with side effects of the steroids which weaken my muscle skeletal system resulting in ruptures of tendons and breaking of bones.  I now feel that I have not only been given a new lease on life but a compelling mission to help others who, with standard medical practices, might not be making good progress and who are loosing hope .¬†   Since 1981, when I was lucky to be diagnosed properly, I have prevailed despite the constant aggressive onslaught of this disease that has included 31 restorative, corrective surgeries, or procedures to keep me functioning. I know that by remaining persistent, focused, and full of faith and gratitude, there is little that I can‚Äôt accomplish, with your help. B‚ÄùH  Any amount would go towards a suggested working ad budget used during a course I am taking, that I already purchased with savings, created by a top performer in this field who was written up in Forbes Magazine in 2015.¬† It will be also used to float me with paying expenses during the time it takes to hit financial independence which is about $1800/mo--my total personal expenses.¬†   I have had a very rough time during the last promotion of my campaign through January where I had to overcome 2 bouts of lung infections so I need a budget again to launch this business.¬† I deeply appreciate the growing community that supports me. ¬†Together, we can do this. ¬†$18 and multiples thereof receive a special blessing as it stands for life.¬†¬†  L'Chaim with Rabbi Yossi.

Without this intervention, his life is in serious danger and worsens over the days. My sister and I appeal to the goodwill of anyone who can contribute in any way to help us solve this difficult situation. We will be eternally grateful for your collaboration to save the life of our father.   Because of the humanitarian crisis and the collapse of the Venezuelan health system, it has been extremely difficult to find and acquires the necessary medical supplies for the intervention. The funds of this campaign will be used for the acquisition of three (3) medicated stents, in addition to 2 guides and 2 balloons for coronary angioplasty, plus 1 kit for coronary angioplasty, through the Industrial Corporation Quifoven II CA and Angiotec.   This campaign is managed by Abraham Corona, Victor Hugo Molero's nephew, and all resources will be transferred directly to companies in the US that will provide the medical supplies for the intervention.",

Trascorriamo mesi vivendo in remoti villaggi della savana e cercando di dare un contributo alla comunit√† masai locale portando vestiti, in particolare felpe per le fredde notti del bush, medicine di cui hanno bisogno e aiutando nell'acquisto di beni di prima necessit√†.   Questa volta per√≤ abbiamo un progetto ben pi√π ampio che da sole non potremmo realizzare: vorremmo creare 2 pozzi per l'acqua e abbiamo bisogno di voi.   Ne vorremmo creare uno per ogni comunit√† dei nostri guerrieri che sono lontani dall'altra: la prima si chiama Msomera ed √® un minuscolo villaggio remoto non facile da raggiungere se non in moto.   Cristina arriv√≤ l√¨ nel 2015 e rimase scioccata nel vedere la fatica dei giovani guerrieri e delle donne che si calavano in grosse buche scavate nel terreno per riemire i loro secchi e li tiravano su pieni e pesanti grazie ad un passaggio di mani.   L'acqua era marrone e fangosa e purtroppo disponibile disponibile.   Qualche anno dopo venne costruito un lago artificiale grandissimo e tutto √® filato liscio fino a pochi mesi fa quando le abbondanti piogge hanno fatto franare parte del lago che adesso non esiste pi√π.   Vorremmo creare un pozzo dove la gente pu√≤ avere acqua pulita senza dover faticare e spezzarsi la schiena sotto il peso dei secchi.   L'altro pozzo invece lo vorremmo costruire vicino al meno isolato villaggio di Kiberashi, dove la popolazione comunque dove camminare ben 30 minuti ed oltre per arrivare all '  acqua sotto la calura del sole africano e portando sulla testa pesanti secchi.   Ci auguriamo di cuore e grazie al vostro supporto di poter aiutare concretamente queste comunit√† messe a dura prova dalla povert√† e dalle sempre pi√π frequenti calamit√† naturali dovute anche ai cambiamenti climatici.

He is paralyzed from the knees down and restricted to a wheel chair. He is a light in everyone that he meets day and always stays positive and is slowly learning to look at his disability in a good way. Currently my family is without a vehicle and when we had one driving him back and forth from doctors appointments and many other daily tasks is very difficult and sometimes uncomfortable for him. A little bit over a year ago Carter and His father Matthew were in a car accident where and ambulance rear ended them and it's only made riding in a vehicle for Carter more traumatic and Matthew has just finally received the surgery to hopefully fix the injuries he acquired in the accident it's been a long struggle and now that Matthew is out off comission i was always the one to put Carter in and out of the vehicle because Matthew cannot and the carters other 9 siblings are a little to young. But now I'm in the Army and not home to help and I want them to have the eaisest possible access to mobility when needed. So that's why I'm trying to raise money to buy my family a wheelchair Accessible van.

My wife has the absolute strongest will to live and 2 overcome extraordinarily difficult circumstances more so than anyone I've ever seen. Everyday she manages to keep going regardless of the pain she feels every second of every day. I promise you the extent of which is astronomical to such a point even when shes able to sleep she tell me there's no relief from the pain she feels. We don't have the money to hire someone to help her out with doing things so I care for her the best I possibly can because I love her more than anything and anyone else I have before yet i fear its not enough especially since being there for her all the time makes it near impossible to keep a steady job. Honestly though I'm starting to feel a bit defeated and extremely overwhelmed since the beginning of our relationship I was aware because of her epilepsy there would be challenges not every normal couple faces that's perfectly fine with me. Then when we found out about the cancer it felt like being sucker punched by Mike Tyson right in the gut. After which we've had ups and downs yet as of lately there's been far more downs. Still we try to maintain some sort of positivity for the chance of a better tomorrow. With everything happening with and around us especially after finding out where we are living is the coronavirus covid 19s epicenter of the whole United States and people with pre underlining health conditions are far more susceptible and likely to die if they get infected aka my wife they say for people who get infected that already have renal conditions the virus can make some people's kidney simply stop working and fail all together so on top of all we're facing there's also now that to worry us and fact in the back of our minds none stop.... Bottom line we need help I honestly don't know what else to attempt to do but ask for help so anybody please help us anyway you can anything helps. We would be extremely thankful for whatever kindness support anybody can help us with.",

The last few months have been a downhill battle for my aunt and our family. My aunt has been struggling with pain and discomfort since September 2019. Finally,¬† on December 2019, she was diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm.   What has made the last few months even more difficult is the sudden death of her daughter and my cousin Marisela; who passed unexpectedly do to a stroke this last December.  Aunt Rosa is completely devastated by the loss of her only living daughter; whom she relied on as her main emotional, financial and physical support.  What moves us to ask for your support, is that Aunt Rosa lives in Venezuela; where there is an economic and political crisis that greatly impacts the cost of the procedure.  As a family we have done everything we can to financially help Aunt Rosa. Unfortunately, we have maxed out our resources.   Aunt Rosa is in urgent need of surgery; the pr√≥tesis alone will cost $800 USD, surgery and other medical expenses will cost $1500 USD ($3000 CAD).¬†\r\n \r\n\r\n We understand if at this time you are not able to make a monetary contribution; it will be greatly appreciated if you can help us by sharing this post on your social media outlets.¬†  We thank you for your support and generosity.\r\n \r\n\r\n   \r\n ",

Their children attended to the school in their village that was build for the most vulnerable families who couldn't pay to go the public school. The family Esqueque attended to a program we started for the families to teach them about education in their homes. That's when they conquered my heart. In the picture you can see the father Carlos, his wife Maria-Elena, and their 4 children: Pedro, Mar√≠a del Carmen, Rosalinda and Anali. In 2010 father Carlos was strugling to find a job to maintain his family. He found a job in a hotel in Antigua, a turistic village nearby. I was very happy for the family. The wages were meager but they could increase a little bit their standard of living.   This month, the corona virus arrived in Guatemala. The hotel where Carlos worked closed his doors. Carlos got fired. Unfortunately, in Guatemala unemployment benefits don't exist. Carlos succeeded to contact me, desperate by the financial situation his family is in.  I have to trie to help them. I proposed to try to rase money through GoFundMe. They were so happy to hear that there might be coming some financial support. Sponsoring this family will mean the world to me, and to them. It will give them food on the table and the possibility for the children to continue to go to school. So they can build a better future for themselves. Carlos has build 1 room for his family where everyone sleeps together in 2 beds. It's his dream to be able to build a second room to have more space for his family. Your funding will help to make their dreams come through!  The money goes directly to the family, sent by Western Union, to father Carlos.¬†  Thank you so much in advance!

We are raising money for tents and other winter supplies for the Seabreeze and the I-80 University Underpass homeless encampments.¬† Each of these encampments experienced increased and repeated Caltrans evictions where they lost tents, storage tubs, and their belongings. Tents provide shelter. Storage tubs provide food protection from the rats. Garbage and waste management mitigate health and safety risks. The residents of these encampments are being proactive by starting their own campaign to improve their living conditions and prepare for winter. We are asking you to help us please.¬†  KC, one of our elders, who is disabled and cannot walk, moved 7 times in 3 weeks. She lost her tent, mattress and many of her belongings. After Caltrans evictions, she had to sleep under a boat sail on a metal bed frame. Thanks to Todd Jersey, a local Berkeley architect, we purchased a new yurt for KC so that she could have shelter and get her wheelchair easily inside. We still need to weatherproof her Yurt and provide her with other needed supplies.¬†  Thank you  Todd Jersey Architecture ¬†   There are similar stories throughout these encampments and we need many more tents donated. Patricia Moore, another resident, needs a Yurt as well because she cannot move her wheelchair in her tent. She needs daily wound care so we need to provide her with fresh bandages and medical supplies.¬†  Patricia Moore in her current tent. She cannot walk and must crawl out of her tent to get into her wheelchair. She cannot roll her wheelchair into her tent so a yurt would give her accessibly and warmth in the winter months.¬†  Winter is coming! These Berkeley residents need to be self-sufficient because city services cannot provide for all of their needs. They are asking the City of Berkeley for trash pick-up, porta potties, and drinking water. They would also like to purchase heavy duty trash bags and containers.¬† Help us help them to create a safe, clean, and weather proof environment.     Our goal is to purchase 50-60 weather proof tents. Unlike when a person goes camping temporarily, these tents will be used as a temporary HOME to get someone through the winter and secure their belongings. The money raised will go toward the purchase of tents and other winter supplies including waterproof tarps. Additionally, some of the money donated will go toward waste and trash management.   A portion of the money raised will provide 30-50 GoGirl's to women so that they can easily use the restroom in uncomfortable spaces.¬†  Find out more information on the  GOGIRL on Amazon. ¬†    The donated supplies will be distributed throughout the encampments equally.¬† At the request of the residents, we will set up a donations tent so that other homeless individuals (throughout Berkeley)¬† can receive the supplies¬† they need. The donations tent will be run by the unhoused residents themselves, who will work as volunteers, keeping inventory, and equally distributing supplies to all of the individuals living in the encampments.   Our new  Community Donations tent from Amazon. ¬†Thank you Sarah W for this contribution!¬†¬†   The unhoused in Berkeley are uniting to demand an answer to the question: Where do we go? Until they ¬†can find a lawful place to be, please help them protect themselves and the most vulnerable in their community from the cold of winter. There are not enough shelter beds or housing. The most vulnerable are our senior citizens and disabled. These communities care and take care of their most vulnerable. They need our help.¬† The current solutions are not working. We need immediate solutions for this winter and community building. Please help us.    For a history of the Where do we go? movement see recent article by  JP Masser: An Intersecting Tale: Berkeley's #WhereDoWeGo Movement Stays Fast. ¬†  Please support  Street Spirit ¬† and purchase a copy of the October 2019 edition from a homeless vendor in Berkeley.

The reason for his passing was due to lung failure, which eventually lead to a heart attack. Our brother was admitted to the homestead hospital on Saturday 01/04/2020, he was in the ICU for a total of 5 days during which he fought his hardest to make it out of his coma but unfortunately his body couldn‚Äôt continue to fight and at 11:46 PM we lost a beautiful soul and gained an angel. Unfortunately, our loved one was heavy set which makes the costs be even higher than usual therefore with a heavy heart we are asking for donations, anything helps, we are very grateful for anything that can be donated to our family in this traumatic event. Thank you.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  El 1/09/2020, nuestro querido hijo, padre, hermano, t√≠o y amigo fue tomado demasiado pronto de la familia Corona. Esta muerte fue inesperada para todos, por lo tanto, la familia no estaba financieramente preparada para asumir los costos de entierro que todos sabemos son rid√≠culamente altos en estos d√≠as. La raz√≥n de su fallecimiento se debi√≥ a una insuficiencia pulmonar, que finalmente condujo a un ataque card√≠aco. Nuestro hermano fue ingresado en el hospital de Homestead el s√°bado 01/04/2020, estuvo en la UCI durante un total de 5 d√≠as durante los cuales luch√≥ con todas sus fuerzas para salir de su coma, pero desafortunadamente su cuerpo no pudo seguir luchando y a las 11:46 PM perdimos un alma hermosa y ganamos un √°ngel. Desafortunadamente, nuestro ser querido ten√≠a bastante sobre peso, lo cual hace que los costos sean a√∫n m√°s altos de lo habitual, por lo tanto, con un dolor en el coraz√≥n estamos pidiendo donaciones, cualquier cosa ayuda, estamos muy agradecidos por todo lo que se pueda donar a nuestra familia en este evento traum√°tico. Gracias.   ",

            "description": "I am an eight grade student attending middle school in California, and I am raising money to help the doctors and citizens in Wuhan, China, who are going through an virus outbreak crisis.  I would like to raise $3,000 to help provide approximately 10,000 disposable surgical masks to the city of Wuhan. Any donation is much appreciated, and all funds will go towards the purchase and shipping of the supplies to hospitals and epidemic prevention centers. Currently, doctors at some hospitals are only allocated one mask per day, while on active duty and treating infected patients. Furthermore, citizens are now required by the Wuhan government to wear face masks to prevent the spread of this virus.  A new coronavirus strain, a pneumonia-like respiratory virus, was recently discovered in China. The new virus is called 2019-nCoV and NBC News states that \"there is no specific treatment for the new virus, and no vaccine to prevent it.\" In December of 2019, there was a huge coronavirus outbreak in the city of Wuhan, China. CNN has confirmed that there are approximately 2,000 infected, while the death toll has risen to 56 people in China as of January 26th. The Wall Street Journal states that the virus has \"quickly spread throughout China and other countries in Asia, and . . . U.S. Health authorities expect that it will spread even further.\"  Wuhan is located in the middle of China and is by no means a small city, with an overall population of 11 million. It is also one of China's most important cities and is considered the political and economical capital of the country. Authorities have issued a citywide lockdown, and all public transport services throughout the city have been suspended until further notice. Main highways leaving Wuhan have been shut down, and airports and railway stations have been temporarily closed to departing passengers. The implementation of the blockade is an immense challenge to transport authorities and is also extremely difficult for people with relatives living in Wuhan. Chinese Lunar New Year is on January 25th this year, but many people cannot visit or see their relatives. CNN describes the situation as \"akin to closing down all transport links for a city more than three times the size of Chicago, two days before Christmas.\"  Thank you so much in advance to anyone who provides a donation, regardless of amount.  My plan: After receiving each $300 worth of donations, I will purchase as many masks as I can and send them to Wuhan Xie He Dongxihu Hospital in Wuhan, Hubei, China (Jing Bei Yi Road, Wuhan, Dongxihu Qu). My parents will also directly call the hospital to ensure that they will know when the shipment arrives. All purchased masks will be shipped to China via a global courier company.",

            "description": "Hello everyone,   You may have heard of the recent outbreak of coronavirus in the city of Wuhan in China. It is a novel virus which is very contagious and causes life-threatening pneumonia in people of all ages. ¬†Unfortunately, there is still no cure for it.   - As of 1/24/2020 8pm local time, it has been reported that  26  people died of this virus infection and  928  are infected in China.   - Numbers keep increasing  exponentially  as more cases were confirmed in Wuhan City and Hubei Province, other provinces of China, other Asian countries and the rest of the world.   - First case infected from this coronavirus in North America was found in Seattle 1/21/2020, and the second case was confirmed in Chicago yesterday 1/23/2020.¬†   - A student of Texas A M University was suspected for possible coronavirus infection after his recent trip to Wuhan yesterday 1/23/2020.  - As of today, China restricts travel of 30 million people in Wuhan as coronavirus death toll rises. City of Wuhan is currently cut off from the rest of the world. All transportation including flights, trains, subways, even personal automobiles etc., have been suspended until further notice. There is very limited supply of gas in all gas station in Wuhan. All schools have been cancelled. For quarantine purpose, no single Wuhan resident is allowed to leave the city.   Here are some reports from major media about this critical situation.     https://www.cnn.com/asia/live-news/coronavirus-outbreak-hnk-intl-01-24-20/index.html      https://www.cnn.com/asia/live-news/wuhan-coronavirus-china-intl-hnk/index.html      https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/world/asia/china-coronavirus-travel.html      https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/health-science/2020/01/23/358285/officials-investigating-suspected-case-of-coronavirus-in-brazos-county/    As a native from the city of Wuhan, I am heartbroken about this situation. I am currently a biomedical scientist in Houston; both of my parents are doctors in a major hospital in Wuhan. They witness more and more patients, as well as doctors are infected by this lethal virus. The only way that can effectively prevent this virus from spreading is as simple as Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), such as  surgical masks ,  N95 aspirators, safety glasses and goggles, and   protective coveralls . Unfortunately, there are more than 11 million people living in Wuhan; currently PPE is extremely short of supply in Wuhan, as well as in the rest area of China. Even worse,  today is the Chinese New Year of Mouse . Millions of people are suffering and their lives are in danger. Production and supply of PPE in China has no way to meet the demand in a timely manner.  We are wondering if any of you can help in any ways, such as funds donation, and/or donation of any number of PPE, and/or help with getting any PPE donation from major manufacturers in the States. I will then coordinate to have them shipped to China as soon as I can.    Earlier, Better.  It will not only help people in Wuhan, but provide further protection for people all of the world, including your beloved ones, from being infected by this contiguous life-threatening virus. I currently live in Houston. I am more than happy to coordinate and help by all means, and make it possible.    Where the funds go, and how the funds are used, will be frequently updated here with all available validated documentation.   (Update 1/28/2020)  One of our local ambassadors in Wuhan, Sibo (Bob) Hu, took this video at his home in Wuhan today 1/28/2020. He sincerely asks your help for relieve this critical situation.¬†   Here is the Youtube link:   https://youtu.be/xWtK_SjpcLI             Any help is greatly appreciated!  Happy New Year of Mouse!

The recent outbreak of coronavirus has devastated the population, with thousands already confirmed to be infected and climbing death tolls every day. Hospitals throughout the province are suffering from an undersupply of medical resources and are pleading for outside support. Recently, a doctor died combatting the virus because they did not have enough protection.  Many people like me have relatives who live in China and are living in constant fear of infection with no way to escape. My uncle's family and my cousins are currently quarantined in the province, and I am personally very worried for their well-being.   I have contacts with hospital officials and medical organizations in Wuhan linked to HUST, where my uncle works. This money will go towards protective gear such as goggles, face masks, and disposable coats that doctors currently need. Details are provided in the \"donating\" section of this document.  A famous phrase in Chinese is \"‰ºóÂøóÊàêÂüé\" (United as one). I believe that this community is a supportive platform for fundraising efforts and knowledge of current world issues. If everyone contributes a small amount, our efforts will become a powerful force in the fight against this calamity.",

I am organizing fundraising to support Wuhan and China fighting coronavirus. All the donations will be donated to Wuhan Red Cross every two to three days instead of waiting for hitting the target because it is very URGENT!   I hope anyone who lives on this earth can join this fight and nib this threat at the beginning. In order to do that, Wuhan China needs help from all of you.  As we all know, the coronavirus that starts from Wuhan China is very deadly and can be transmitted through the air. No known treatment has been proven effective toward the coronavirus. The reported cases have been doubled several times over the last two weeks. Confirmed cases have reached 1362 in mainland China and other 38 confirmed cases have been reported all over the world.   Feb 24th is Lunar new year for Chinese people which means it is when Chinese goes home and unite with families and celebrate. This means that most organizations and even the government are functioning with very few staff and resources. This makes fighting this battle so much harder at the beginning and has made a time window that can effectively contain the virus much smaller.  Wuhan hospitals‚Äô medical workers are working three shifts a day for the last two weeks due to an overwhelming number of patients and limited staff.  Overworked Chinese doctor collapses from exhaustion   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoZHhPr9Xx8   Chinese hospital staff in Wuhan face fears amid a frontline battle against coronavirus outbreak   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7llqJcvkxM   Wuhan Coronavirus outbreak: pity doctor crying   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozpoRDm4zCA   you may not understand Chinese, but I believe you can hear desperation from his voice.  15 medical workers have been contracted with the virus and one doctor Lian Wudong has sacrificed his life in this battle. Here is a video to mourn this hero.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyOXPhSsfNI   Why Wuhan needs your support and how bad the situation is right now??  If you are only reading news from western media, you may not feel as related as I do. I will explain this to you in examples you may feel more relaxed.  Wuhan is the biggest city in Hubei Province. They have the best hospital, medical equipment and doctors in the provinces. Yet they are still struggling not only because the virus is impossible to treat at this stage but also they don‚Äôt have enough medical supplies like goggles, masks, protective suits. Other cities and towns in Hubei Province, many of them are, I don‚Äôt want to say this but, are third-world and there are huge populations in those cities. This is actually the worst part of all situation. An outbreak can happen at any moment.  I will continue to add more information to this post.  If you are in Vancouver and willing to meet me in person, I will be happy to meet you. We can come together and strategize a bigger plan to prepare for the worst situation.  I will also connect universities and colleges to join us in fundraising.  ¬†No preparation will be too much until the virus is fully contained and completely eliminated from this earth.     ¬†  1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Donation Channel 1: All the donation will go to Wuhan Red Cross (this is the one you are reading right now)  2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Donation Channel 2: All the donations will be used to order a medical supply for Wuhan Hospital. The factory in China will take the order and manufacture supplies and sent them directly to Wuhan hospitals. (Will be opened in next few days)  All the activities will be posted on social media and can be monitored by anyone.",

Not only does the public need these to protect themselves, doctors and nurses are in need for these masks. Medical masks are selling out in China, let's raise money to buy medical masks for the people who need them in the Wuhan crisis.  I am a high school student with a Chinese background. Having parents who immigrated from China almost 10 years ago, I still have relatives and friends living in China. There is no doubt that I am worried about them with the highly contagious virus surrounding them.¬†  With more people being admitted to hospitals, the virus is spreading, and doctors and nurses are in need for medical equipment. As doctors and nurses attempt to save patients, masks are very critical to them as they can prevent the virus from spreading. 15 nurses have confirmed to be in contact with the virus due to attempting to save others, but more have yet to come. These people in the medical field are spending time in the hospital saving lives rather than celebrating the 2020 Chinese new year, they should be appreciated and also supported. Not only in the medical field, masks are also worn by the public. These single use masks are bought and thrown everyday, and the demand for these only increase. As many places are in need for masks, I hope to raise money to support hospital facilities in China.¬†  While normal masks are good, we need to buy N95 medical masks. These masks are more safe and are used in hospital facilities. I hope to raise money to buy these masks, then ship them to hospitals in China to save lives.¬†  I hope to: 1) Raise enough money and reach our goal 2) Buy N95 medical masks¬† 3) Ship to Wuhan XieHe hospital, Wuhan Medical Treatment Center (JingYiTan Hospital)) along with other hospitals that need it.¬†  It would be so kind of you for your support, every penny counts. :)    https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/25/world/asia/china-coronavirus.html    Edit/Update: First batch ordered!

At the moment i am in China because i wanted to celebrate Chinese new year so i am in the middle of all the problems that are occur at the moment. the sick people that cant reach out for an hospital are laying on the streets because there are not enough beds and space. But instead of only reading about all the problems i feel the need of helping out the people in the infected area.  I think that the best place to gather money for the people that need it the most is here on the platform gofundme. if anyone has any other ideas to help out the people in china send me an email ‚Äújurrys@outlook.com‚Äù  even if you dont want to donate money but you have supplies like facemasks and gloves it would be much apreciated. We need to stop the virus from spreading around and stop this disaster from getting even bigger.  lets  unite ¬†and help out the victims of this virus.  \r\n \r\n\r\n   Update  4/02/2020. The victims that are infected at the moment is over 20.000 and the people that have died is 425. Those numbers are to big because its hard for al these people to get the medical supplies and protection that they need.  Ive spend almost al my savings just to hand out facemasks and gloves for everyone that wants it but its just not enough.\r\n \r\n\r\n I hope i can keep doing this with your help. 50 facemasks at the moment costs around 40 dollars U.S.\r\n \r\n\r\n If there is a place to get it cheaper please send me and email or respond on this platform.        ¬†  \r\n ",

Recently a traveler from China by way of Mexico City landed at LAX. It was a random screening that they found this person to have symptoms of this virus.¬† CDC directed this person to the hospital immediately.¬†   ¬† Towards the end of January a scheduled flight of private citizens from Wuhan will land at SFO. We have not as a country,¬† state or planet quarantined this virus.¬† There will hopefully be a vaccine,¬† but that will take months.¬† It is a very real illness and only in it's infancy.¬†¬†  ¬† Many may get ill, but won't die.¬† It has been suggested by the CDC¬† based on previous carona virus outbreaks (SARS, MERS) that the people most at risk will be those who are most vulnerable and disadvantaged.¬† Underlying health conditions is seen in homelessness at an alarmingly high rate.¬† The lack of resources,¬† education and safety will put them at risk for catching this virus.¬†¬†  ¬†They live in our communities, we see them every day. That alone puts us at risk, too.¬† This is highly contagious and is thought to be spread via respiratory droplets, but it is also demonstrating that it can spread exponentially from a point of contact.¬† Meaning you don't have to be exposed to the sick person¬† to get the virus.  ¬† N-95 masks¬† protect and prevent droplet transmission.¬† Alcohol sanitization promotes good hygiene and is recommended by the CDC to be included in prevention measures.¬†¬†  ¬† The masks are expensive and it's not realistic to believe that the homeless could afford one if they knew they needed it. Education is essential.¬†¬†  ¬† I will go out into the community and reach out to those willing to be educated and provide them with supplies to protect themselves.¬† This to help out not only the homeless, but our community as well.   ¬† My experience to take on this project is 10+ years working as an ER/ICU nurse in¬† America's largest busiest hospitals, including those right here in Los Angeles.

With the pandemic spread of a Novel¬† Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan, China, thousands of people there have been infected by this virus and suffered from the deadly pneumonia. It is predicted that this virulent virus may spread quickly in China and globally to many countries including the United States. In fact, at least one patient in Texas was suspected to have the virus infection. We, the Houston International Cultural Center (HICC), an 501C(3) non-profit community organization, is raising funds and collecting protective medical supplies such as masks for people who are infected by 2019-nCoV in China. We greatly appreciate your donations and any donation will make an impact for the people who are struggling in sickness or in high risk of being infected. We thank you in advance for your generous contribution to this humane cause. Please join us to make a difference!¬†  The Houston International Cultural Center (HICC) is committed to serve local communities in Houston and Texas through multicultural communications, arts, culture, education, and other services. We sincerely invite you to join this team effort, we firmly believe that together we can make a difference for the world!  Masks and other protective medical supplies are necessity for people's protection in such a serious virus infection. In many places of China, masks are already sold out of stock.

            "description": "These two beautiful girls were National Champions on the debate circuit when they were recruited to coach Chinese Students in Shanghai. After 6 months of working over in Shanghai, a Carona virus has broken out, and they are trying to get out with their lives! So far the Chinese students have been put under quarantine until 2/29 but the adults are still able to get out, as of now. The availability on flights are booked full in coach so each one had to buy a one way ticket in business class. Now they are under time pressure to get out before a full quarantine goes into effect or before they are stricken with the virus. If they make it out, they will immediately be unemployed and facing the cost of their airfair out. Please help these two make it home safely and expeditiously with no credit card debt, as a result of last minute airfair. Any donation amount would be Greatly Appreciated. Please keep them in your prayers as well!",

            "description": "Coronavirus, a newly discovered illness that can evolve, infect humans, and spread between humans, is threatening hundreds of millions of people's life. The outbreak started in China, Wuhan, in December 2019. It is more contagious than SARS. Currently, there is NO cure for this illness. According to the government's report, in China, 2785 people have been diagnosed with coronavirus. 5794 people are suspected of being infected. 81 people have died. The actual number of infections and deaths is much bigger than the reported ones. Due to the lack of facilities and sickbed positions in hospitals, many people are only waiting for deaths at home.¬† Every day hundreds of people are diagnosed with coronavirus. Wuhan, a city of eleven million people, has temporarily shut down to inhibit the rapid spreading of the virus.¬† Medical facilities, food, and masks have been depleted. The only masks that work to prevent infection are n95, 3M, and surgical masks. However, they can only be used for 4 hours per mask. Thus, not even Chinese citizens, doctors and nurses who are treating the infected patients are facing the scarcity of masks. Worse, five millions of Wuhan citizens have fled to other cities of China before the shutdown, which means the number of potentially infected people is unimaginable. China estimates that the peak of the infection rate will be around mid-February, meaning the most devastating crisis has yet to come. In all Chinese cities, schools are delayed and all public facilities are shut down.¬†  Moreover, coronavirus has spread overseas. According to CNN, there are more than 50 confirmed cases in 13 places outside of mainland China, including at least five in the United States. Furthermore, people can spread the virus before symptoms show.¬†  Facing the devil himself, instead of retreating to obtain a chance of living, thousands of Chinese doctors and nurses voluntarily signed petitions to treat infected patients. Now, at least 30 doctors and nurses have been infected. Some have already passed away. Hundreds of millions of Chinese people's lives are at stake. The only way we can help them is to purchase a massive amount of masks, goggles, protective suits, and medical facilities, and transport them to China. This takes lots of money. We need your help to fight against this menacing illness.",

But these days, death leaves no escape reminding everyone that life is short and death, inevitable.  ¬†In recent news, death has stacked up like coins slotting in connect four.

At the same time, patients are in isolation, not knowing whether the new virus will claim their lives.   I wait for it to pass, dodging coughs and sneezes while mumbling a simple prayer hoping my pack of face masks and beliefs will be enough to keep me from falling ill. I'm thankful it's not me who is quarantined.   Yet with each new death toll, and hourly update, my sitting here is not enough. I click another video and the desperation of those isolated and afraid force tears in my eyes.  ¬†A few fundraisers that have already popped up, but I started this one for my community. If I'm honest, I'm still hesitant in creating this, as doubt forms silly questions, ‚ÄúWill I meet or even come close to my goal?‚Äù I have decided not to let it stop me.

I'm raising money to donate to Give2Asia, who will be able to fund for medical supplies, food, and proper long-term medical training for those currently living in the quarantined province of Hubei in China. Any donation will help make an impact. As we are all aware, the coronavirus has been responsible for the deaths of 81 people worldwide, and over 2,800 people infected worldwide. These numbers are bound to keep rising as the coronavirus is an extremely contagious airborne disease with no current known cure. Major hospitals in China in the Hubei province, the site of the first recorded cases of the virus, have reported a dangerous shortage of medical supplies such as goggles, Level A Hazmat suits, masks, and gloves. With the entire province of Hubei in lockdown, citizens would also inevitably suffer from a shortage of food, water, and other necessary daily supplies. This virus is spreading quickly worldwide, and we need to do everything in our power to help in the efforts of stopping the rapid spread of this disease before its extensive damage and resulting casualties reaches the rest of the world. All donations would immediately go to the nonprofit organization Give2Asia. Thank you in advance for your contribution to this cause. Every single penny makes a difference.  More information about Give2asia (G2a): Our mission is to strengthen communities throughout Asia by building trusted networks for charitable investment. We envision healthy and prosperous communities supported by an expanded flow of philanthropy and locally-led development. Our work focuses on key issues such as healthcare, the environment, disaster preparedness and relief, and poverty alleviation. We believe that local knowledge counts: Give2Asia has a team of local staff, in-country advisors, and partners in every country where we work, ensuring projects are effective, results are transparent, and grant recipients are accountable.  Give2Asia is one of the few international NGOs registered to support local causes in China. We are honored to have received special permission from Chinese authorities to accept donations to support local response efforts for this crisis.\r\n \r\n\r\n Our nonprofit partners in China have provided a preliminary needs assessment. Your donations will be used for:  - Procuring masks, protection suits, goggles, and other necessary medical equipment for the treatment and containment - Providing meals and lodging to the thousands of health workers traveling to areas most affected by the outbreak - Long-term training and support for medical workers working on the front lines of this and future epidemics\r\n ",

            "description": "Hello everyone,  My name is Vivian Hu, and I am currently a senior at Laguna Blanca High School in Santa Barbara, California. I grew up in Wuhan, China. In fact, many of my family and friends still reside there.  Sunday January 26th was the Chinese New Year ‚Äì in our culture, it is the time when people in China are the most lively and happy. It is our practice that everyone puts down their hard work and studies to return home and be surrounded by family and friends. But this Chinese New Year everything changed completely with the outbreak of a new deadly disease commonly referred to as the Coronavirus.¬†  The Coronavirus is a new virus that has been transmitted from animals to humans. The mutation of the virus becomes stronger as it moves on from person to person. The person who is infected with the disease will develop a fever, cough, inflammation of both lungs, kidney failure, and the last stage which leads to death. According to official Chinese statistics, more than 45,000 people have been infected in mainland China alone. Approximately 1,357 people have died from the Coronavirus worldwide, a number that is expected to rise each day.¬†¬†  The Coronavirus outbreak particularly touches me, as well as my friends and family. Most of the infected and diseased people live in my hometown of Wuhan. Due to the sudden outbreak, the hospitals are at full capacity of patients, and medical teams have not received any rest since the outbreak. This virus overlapped with the Spring Festival traffic, causing a series of problems in the spreading of the virus with more human contact. As you may already know, the government made a decision to shut down all pathways leading in and out of Wuhan. Therefore, essentially shutting down my hometown. People will no longer have access to railways, highways, and airports until further notice. This official shutdown has caused the people of my hometown an even greater danger and inconvenience. The people of Wuhan know that the shutdown is not to seal the freedom of life of millions of citizens there, but to prevent the virus from spreading out of Wuhan. The city of Wuhan is taking steps to prevent the spreading of the virus.¬† One, being that the government has built two independent hospitals outside of the city‚Äîwith the capacity to treat 3,000 people.¬†¬†¬†  Because of this nationally-known epidemic, the demand for face masks and protective medical clothing is running critically low. In particular, face masks are out of stock at nearly all of the drug stores in the city and many people are unable to purchase what can potentially save their life.¬†  The money raised by this fundraiser will be used to buy SP Surgical Masks through Wing Sea Co., Ltd. in Japan. There is currently a shortage of face masks available worldwide, but this supplier has agreed to work with me to ensure that medical grade face masks make it to Wuhan. All masks will be sent by the supplier directly to Hankou Hospital in Wuhan, China, where they will be distributed as necessary throughout the community. I am in direct communication with the supplier and will ensure that the money gets to them and that the face masks make it to the Hankou Hospital in Wuhan.  The citizens of Wuhan need our encouragement, support, and help immediately. I ask that you be mindful and show your appreciation as they are sacrificing their own health to ensure that the virus does not spread any further.  As a Wuhan native in the United States, I can only put in my modest efforts.  PLEASE DONATE NOW TO THE PEOPLE OF WUHAN   Thank you in advance for your donation so that I can support my hometown of Wuhan from here.",

US health experts have predicted that the Coruna virus will kill tens of millions of people according to a report published in the British Daily Mail. So far, the highly contagious disease sweeping across China has killed 100 people and injured more than 1,771, but experts expect that the true number to be many thousands.   ¬†  The authorities have closed the city of Wuhan, which is the epicenter of the new corona virus. While medical authorities around the world are seeking to prevent its spread.¬†The spread of the epidemic virus, depends on several factors. Including the¬†severity¬†of the disease, the ease of transmission between people, the population density, the availability of health services, and the nature of the place where the disease spread, and movement of travelers. ¬†  ‚ÄúA global health threat‚Äù There are fears that the infection will accelerate as hundreds of millions of Chinese travel at home and abroad during the Lunar New Year holidays, although many cancel their flights. Airports around the world have strengthened screening for travelers from China, although some health officials and experts question the utility of such checks.,   we have lived in south korea for a while for study but we never prepared for something like that and now we are scared to be a victim of the virus , we need some help from you to making an airplane ticket for the come back , its really needed at the moment , and we hope world leaders could make this virus stop soon.  thanks for all your support¬†   ",

            "description": "Chinese New Year is supposed to be filled with happiness from family gatherings and celebrations. However, the epidemic of Coronavirus has shattered the joy and infused us with agitation and horror. The virus started from Wuhan and have spread to every single province in China. As more cases are confirmed worldwide, the Coronavirus outbreak has become a pandemic.\r\n\r\n\r\nBased on the 01/27 report of WHO, 2741 people in China have been diagnosed with the virus, and among these people, 461 of them have progressed to the severe stage. So far, 80 people have died, and 5794 people are suspected of the virus. The statistics are still going up, and everyone is extremely devastated. \r\n\r\n\r\nEvery hospital in China is packed with patients; all the doctors and nurses have been fighting restlessly on the frontline, but the medical supplies are far from enough. Many doctors are infected, and excessive amounts of hazmats, masks, and goggles are in great demand. \r\n\r\n\r\nPeople who don‚Äôt have the symptoms are trying to prevent the virus by isolating themselves at home. However, many of them don‚Äôt possess any masks or eye goggles to protect themselves because all the masks are sold out, and donations of resources from other countries are imperative. \r\n\r\n\r\nI‚Äôm student from Lawrence Academy, and I believe that we, as humans, can all unite together and fight through the Coronavirus. Love is power, and we are full of power when in unity. With your help, we can alleviate the disastrous conditions even if it‚Äôs little by little. Small differences will add up to big changes. On behalf of the Chinese communities, we would like to thank you for lending us a hand through kind donations, and your help will be appreciated and remembered forever! \r\n\r\n",

After personally spending 15 years living and working in China and also having a 10year old son in the Country, I know first hand the devastation this virus has caused people. With deaths rising every day and no sign of the virus subsiding, the country is in short supply of vital medical equipment that could be used to save lives. With the elderly and children at greatest risk of developing pneumonia if they contract the virus.  It pains me that my son cannot go to school, play football with his friends or even go to the local cinema but at least he can walk around outside because is fortunate enough to have a face mask. However, there are millions of children and elderly who don‚Äôt have this option and they are housebound 24 hours a day.  Imagine your parents, children, sick relatives not having access to medical supplies that could enable them to leave their house. Simple tasks like buying food and drink, are impossible without face masks or protective eye goggles. The risk of them contracting coronavirus are so high they are now housebound.  A simple facemask could help them safely go to the shops for vital supplies. Imagine being left with the choice of contracting a deadly virus or starving because of a huge shortage in simple precautionary measures .    China is known as super-power in the world, this go fund me is not about money or financial needs, its about supplying urgent medical supplies to areas in the most need. So at the risk of repeating myself, this is not about sending money to China, this is about helping the Chinese people who can not gain access to the most simple of protection equipment.  Schools are closed, businesses have been shut down, children are unable to leave their houses if they don‚Äôt have the appropriate protection.   All donations we receive will be used to buy face masks and protection goggles here in the UK and will be sent to Wuhan directly through the Chinese red cross to help children and the elderly immediately.  ¬£2 can buy a face mask for a child which can help them to just go outside their home.    Please donate anything you can, and know that you are enabling someone to live their life as normally as they can whilst living with the outbreak.  I personally thank you in advance, and I am sure that the Chinese people would also like me to pass on their thanks for any protective equipment that they receive because of your donation.",

Not only does the public need these to protect themselves, doctors and nurses are in need for these masks. Medical masks are selling out in China, let's raise money to buy medical masks for the people who need them in the Wuhan crisis.  With more people being admitted to hospitals, the virus is spreading, and doctors and nurses are in need for medical equipment. As doctors and nurses attempt to save patients, masks are very critical to them as they can prevent the virus from spreading. 15 nurses have confirmed to be in contact with the virus due to attempting to save others, but more have yet to come. These people in the medical field are spending time in the hospital saving lives rather than celebrating the 2020 Chinese new year, they should be appreciated and also supported. Not only in the medical field, masks are also worn by the public. These single use masks are bought and thrown everyday, and the demand for these only increase. As many places are in need for masks, I hope to raise money to support hospital facilities in China.¬†  While normal masks are good, we need to buy N95 medical masks. These masks are more safe and are used in hospital facilities. I hope to raise money to buy these masks, then ship them to hospitals in China to save lives.¬†  I hope to: 1) Raise enough money and reach our goal 2) Buy N95 medical masks¬† 3) Ship to Wuhan XieHe hospital, Wuhan Medical Treatment Center (JingYiTan Hospital)) along with other hospitals that need it.¬†  It would be so kind of you for your support, every penny counts. :)",

            "description": "Our goal (‰∏≠ÊñáÁâàÂú®‰∏ãÊñπ):¬†  With the situation around the Coronavirus worsening daily, the demand for safety supplies such as hand sanitizers and rubbing alcohol are increasing as you are reading this.¬† Every day more than a thousand people are diagnosed with the Coronavirus worldwide. Attached is a video, a story of a doctor leaving his family to fight the Coronavirus. We are just a group of students from boarding schools in the U.S., and we are trying to help the situation at home.¬† We are becoming more and more concerned about the safety and well-being of our loved ones who are still in China.¬†¬†  With your help, we hope to assist the process of developing a cure through purchasing antiseptics for hospitals in the epicenter of the Coronavirus.¬† We have already successfully reached out to a factory in Shandong province that manufactures antiseptics, around 600 miles North East of Wuhan, who is willing to manufacture extra antiseptics for the hospitals in Wuhan.  We assure you that all of your kind donations will go to the purchase of gallons of hand antiseptics crucial to the medical staff who are battling the Coronavirus on the front line.¬† ¬†  Your kind donation will mean a lot to us, our family members, and those who are unfortunately under the grasp of the Coronavirus.¬†¬†  For any more questions regarding the situation in Wuhan, please feel free to contact us, and we will do our best to answer you.¬†¬†  Sincerely,¬†  Alesia Zhou - Stevenson ‚Äò22¬† Clark Dong - Hotchkiss ‚Äò22¬† Jeff Shan - Stevenson ‚Äò23 Ethan Sun - Berkshire '23 Changyu Wang - Piedmont '20   Dr. Liu‚Äôs story:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IneFBNpi8MU   The outbreak of the n-CoV virus has already affected millions of people worldwide.¬† In search of cures for the Coronavirus, doctors across China have volunteered to be on the front lines of the battle at the epicenter of this plague. In the video we have attached, a forty-four-year-old veteran doctor from the SARS outbreak nearly two decades ago, The Wenchuan Earthquake, The Yushu Earthquake, once-again, left his family in Xi‚Äôan to battle another deadly virus.¬†  The camera crew of South China Morning Post recorded the last breakfast and goodbye shared between the doctor and his wife before he enters the war zone.¬† In the video, the horror in her eyes are visible, and the fear in her voice is audible. She has already done everything she can to prepare her husband for his journey, but she can only do so much.  We also accept donation through Wechat Pay (QR Code pasted at the end of the story) Thank you very much for your support!

As a Chinese immigrant, seeing all the immense pain and suffering of people this virus has caused, I have decided to call out and do something, anything, to help! However, only myself is not enough. I am urging everyone that is reading this; please help me raise money to fight against this terrible disease. 100% of the donations will go towards the Hubei Charity Federation for use in treatment and prevention against the virus. Since the Federation is in China and gofundme does not connect with International charities, my mom, Yanjuan Zhen, would have to withdraw the funds to her bank account first,¬† and then donate the money to Hubei. After completing the process, I will send screenshots of the proof of the transaction through email. Thank you so much for your generosity, and have a great day!

My brother is a senior at Canterbury School not too far away, in New Milford, CT. I want to represent my family, and the city of Hangzhou, to raise money for fighting the Coronavirus in Wuhan.¬†  Normally, this is the time for the Chinese New Year celebration. People get together with their family and celebrate all the good things to come in the new year. This year, however, things are quite different. People are not going out to visit their family, barely any celebrations are held, and the city of Wuhan looks dead on the street. This is all because of the coronavirus, as many of you might have heard from the news.¬†  Three times in the twentieth century, coronaviruses have emerged as causes for deadly pandemics: SARS in 2003, MERS in 2012, and now nCoV in Wuhan, 2019. As of January. 25th, the new coronavirus has reportedly led to the infection of at least 2081 people and caused at least 56 deaths. The numbers show no sign of stopping.¬†  While the city of Wuhan has been sealed off, it is reported that at least five million people had left the city hours before the lockdown. We don't know which city they are going, but one thing is certain: that wherever they go, the diseases will continue to spread to all parts of China, or perhaps beyond.¬†  While my brother and I are currently studying in America, we feel a strong sense of connection and empathy for the people in Wuhan, and in other parts of China. My mother, father, and grandma are still in Hangzhou, and we want to do what we can to protect as much people as we can, from being infected with the coronavirus.¬†  I will represent my family, and the city of Hangzhou, to use the money collected to buy and donate high-quality facial masks to Wuhan. I believe that what we are doing is not only to help the people in Wuhan, but also to be responsible for ourselves. Protecting more people from getting the virus will also help reduce the chances of all of us getting infected as well, no matter where we are. I hope that you choose to help Wuhan with me, and I hope our contribution goes a long way. Thank you!",

Unfortunately, the airline they flew was China Airlines.¬† Their return trip has them stopping in China, however, it appears this doorway has been closed.¬† The outbreak of the deadly Corona Virus has made travel through China nearly impossible.¬† We have tried calling and getting information online, but China Airlines has gone dark on us.  Now we need your help! The girls need to come home in less than 2 weeks.¬† We are trying to come up with the funds to bring them home on a different airline and it looks like we can bring all 5 of them home for our goal of $2,855 ($571 each keeps them clear of China).¬† Will you help open a new doorway and bring them home?¬†   We would like to thank each one of you for your support, whether it‚Äôs a small donation or kind thoughts and prayers, everything helps!  Thank you so much.   P.S.¬† UPDATE...All five girls are in a full time volunteer work and also work part time jobs to put gas in their tanks and cover rent and food.¬† They traveled to India as cheaply as they could and will find it very difficult to add another $571 to their budget.¬† We have made arrangements for a small loan in order to book them on another airline and we don't want you to think that they are stranded, but they all are broke and will appreciate very much anything that helps them to continue enjoying their volunteer work with less stress.

In WuHan, China, where the virus started, there has been a shortage of medical supplies for those in need, further worsening the situation.

Corona virus has not yet been reported in Sierra Leone, even though there is a strong ties with China. The virus is spreading worldwide and cases are now being confirmed in Africa. The World Health Organization has declared it a world health emergency. Help and support are urgently needed to fight the spread of this fatal infection and to prevent it from becoming a global epidemic. Our goal is to save the lives of our school children, their families and communities.   Challenge  Containment and treatment of the pneumonia-like virus is critical. The novel corona-virus is spreading rapidly. Hundreds of Sierra Leonean do business and studies in China, and may be unknowing carriers and spreaders of the virus during their movement or when Chinese ships dock in the country. With little education, the virus can spread quickly with destructive impact to our people. The need for education while this is still not the case is urgent and the time is now!   Solution  Donations to this fund will support awareness efforts and services before communities will be affected. Funds donated will be used: ¬∑¬†¬† To produce and distribute thousands of educational flyers and leaflets, bulletin boards to schools and communities including farmers and petty traders ¬∑¬†¬† Conduct school and small community educational meetings ¬∑¬†¬† Social media, Radio and TV discussions ¬∑¬† ¬†Purchase and distribution of Soaps, Sanitizers and water bottles to students and schools, water buckets and cups to schools and communities, sanitary pads to girls during menstruation ¬∑¬† ¬†Emergency arrangement provided for a suspected carrier  ¬†Your donation will reach thousands of local school children and their communities on how to detect symptoms, what to do in order to prevent transmission and how to practice health precautions when a case starts to appear.    Long-Term Impact  We believe that our organization is deeply rooted in local communities and we are in the best position to raise awareness and sensitize the populace to work together to help stop the spread of this deadly virus and any other crises. By funding this campaign, it will have a potential to build stronger response capacity, to face future outbreaks. We will post reports about how funds have been used to donors. The health and wellness of our school children and their communities is paramount. With very high education and awareness, if an outbreak happens, the virus spread will be contained and damage will be minimal.",

This virus originated in Wuhan, China and has so far killed over 200 people along with over 9,811 sickened people worldwide. I must be very clear and honest with you all, but this virus is far MORE dangerous than the SARS or MERS Virus, since no cure has yet been found. Within the last couple of days, the death toll of this virus at first was at 60, and recently has risen to over 200 deaths.¬† According to news sources like, CNN, New York Times, and to the local San Francisco Chronicle, the CDC and other health officials fear that the death rate is only increasing at this point. I hereby am asking you to support me in any kind of way in order to fund more tests and fund money in order to find a cure quickly.

We are currently stuck and all we have is hope and pray for a better day, unfortunately we need o stock up food and people in most cities especially Wuhan province are mostly complaining about shops closing down and its evident shops may run out of supply because shelves are not being restocked and city lock downs is definitely affecting transport. I would love to be helped so that i can also be able to help other students in other places in whatever way i can be helping pay for their supplies. Not all of us are able to deal with this unforeseen epidemic in china, for it has hit as a surprise. The world health organisation declaring this to be serious is really scary, so to stay safe people have to avoid outdoor activities and exposure, stocking up food and other necessities is the way to go.  In any way anyone could help will be appreciated, not only will i be helped but i will make sure to extend the act of kindness to whoever i can.  THANK YOU ",

This Gofundme page is setup to help fundraising for purchasing medical supplies for Wuhan hospitals, doctors, nurses,¬† healthcare workers,¬† medical microbiologists, volunteers in Wuhan, China whose currently fighting to save all these innocent lives. Yes, we know the virus spread too quickly for anyone to react. We know the cause of the virus and we know there are human responsibilities in this BUT not everyone deserves to be infected or die.¬†  Wuhan was once my home when I was a child and I still have family there. Unfortunately, 2 of my close family members including¬† a healthcare worker are currently isolated in hospital in Wuhan suffering from the coronavirus. We are lucky that they received treatment. We are lucky that we had these healthcare workers to save them! We are grateful, and we are heart broken at the same time, because we know how serious this is and we are still experiencing the possibilities of loosing close family members we want to help! And we need your help! We want every doctor, nurse, healthcare workers, medical microbiologist, volunteer, and patient to go home safely! I am lucky, I live in USA currently, I am lucky that I did not get stuck in Wuhan city because I no longer live in Wuhan. I am lucky I have so much resources! But whose there to help them, and the true heroes?  Currently, my cousin who was a reporter in Wuhan is in direct contact with many hospitals bypassing government or other organizations. Yes, we want to make sure that every pieces of supply gets delivered directly to the hospitals! We need to help and protect the frontline fighters whose risking everything to save our family and my home.¬†  Due to Wuhan city and many other cities lockdowns, shortage of supplies, increased pricing on these supplies set lots of restrictions and limitation. In Wuhan, China, we raised about $10000 and purchased only 600 pieces of protected clothing delivered to assigned hospitals.¬† This is truly NOT ENOUGH...Therefore, our family decided to connect together at this tough time to raise more fundings to help even if the prices are expensive...these medical supplies are life savers!¬†  Right now, flights no longer go to Wuhan and due to varies of other reasons, even if we ship supplies to Wuhan, it does not get distributed to the needed hospitals. So we have to purchase and gather the supplies in China! To make sure we get the required high quality supplies, we need more funds to purchase them. We will guarantee to purchase the medical supplies and deliver them directly to each hospitals that we work with. We already completed round 1 so we know this works! That's why we want to continue!          Many people are in lockdown in their community in Wuhan, Hubei,¬† other areas in China so we have to depend on these warm hearted volunteers to help us move and deliver these items to hospitals! We need to protect them too!!!!!¬†       And IF you have resources or supplies in Wuhan and China, please please contact me and I can link you up with my cousin. During this time, please stop the discrimination to Wuhan people. We know human beings made mistakes, other organizations did too but we should stop blaming and hating, we should stick together to help! We need to have a kind heart and generous actions to support! Even if is just a little help, even if you could just help me share the page, we truly appreciated! And we are thankful for everyone whose helping and praying to get through this tough times!¬†  We know there's lots of different voices, political views, fake supplies etc. BUT let's put that all aside and just focus on one purpose, HELP and SUPPORT Wuhan and save innocent lives! Inside Wuhan City, we¬† truly are still in urgent need of supplies!  Please find the news links to see more details about the coronavirus.   https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/01/asia/coronavirus-wuhan-discrimination-intl-hnk/index.html     https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-we-know-about-the-wuhan-virus-11579716128       https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/    Please contact me through Gofundme if you have resources or supplies in China!¬†  I would like to thank everyone in advance!

Until less than a month, the epidemic had spread to more than half of the continent, and new coronaviruses were found in 23 provinces of China. There were 213 deaths in China and 9,692 confirmed cases. In this serious situation, the Hong Kong government has not only failed to improve the measures to respond to the epidemic, has not provided enough medical supplies, and was recently discovered that the government has a stock of 10 million masks, but it has not properly distributed them to the public, causing people panic.

We set out with a ‚ÄúNaaseh Venishmah‚Äù state of mind, just following orders. We began our journey in Combodia, Southeast Asia, only planning to be there for a nice and explorative seven days. But as the saying goes; ‚Äúman plans and god laughs‚Äù. To our complete surprise, we are compelled to continue traveling and wandering through the world for at least another month. As some may find this as a blessing in disguise, we are in utter dismay. We miss our home in China, we are hungry, and we are broke. We were thrown this curve ball, leaving us homeless in a third workout country.  Please, we strongly urge u to generously open ur wallets to us money and help us get through this.

This January with the  outbreak of Coronavirus  at Wuhan my hometown‚ù§, I realized and is experiencing such a life-threatening moment for my family who are infected with the virus and hundreds of thousands of people are suffering this novel virus with pneumonia and hard to breath problem (China‚Äôs number is less than what‚Äôs real). They are on the fringe of fighting the virus through their own Immune Systems and Antivirus/antibacterial medicines with the city under quarantine, but the  sad thing is they lack medical supplies of masks, goggles, protection suits  to prevent the virus  from transmission to more people at the hospitals and communities at Wuhan  (even they also lack medicines, since those are prescription drugs there is no way we can purchase). Even though lots of people are trying to help in this matter including myself and my husband, there still lots of things we need to do and lots of supplies we need to send to China. As you may know Alibaba, Taobao those big online stores in China is sold out of masks, goggles, we are purchasing  supplies here at US to send back to China . Since its two of us on our part, we realized its wiser and better if we can collect help from the humanitarian society to help accelerate the process. If you are there and willing to help this effort, any dollar or connection with those supplies is welcomed! I attached all those first-hand information and the real moments of my friends circle on Wechat (a Chinese chat tool) to show you what‚Äôs really going on. And with all the dollars raised I‚Äôll  buy those supplies  and reply this crowdfunding with the  purchasing sheets and shipping information  to show how your money goes. Please also  send prayers  for Wuhan, I believe God can hear us!

One of the bigger problem in China now is the lack of medical supplies. The doctors, nurses and patients at the front line hospitals are running out of Medical Coveralls, Surgical Masks, Face Shields and Protective Goggles. The protective gear most in demand is the protective clothes (Medical Coveralls). It is so crucial to protect the medical staff and it takes so much longer to manufacture. This is not to mention the broader community in China are not able to buy any of those. There is also ad appearing in Chinese social media and online market to buy back used face masks to recycle, which has upset lots of people. I am not here to ask for your donation. Of course you are most welcome if you feel generous. We have raised some money offline and the problem is the purchasing channel has been dried up. We don‚Äôt know where we can buy these medical supplies. I am asking for help, if you are a medical equipment supplier, or if you know anyone who works in the industry and willing to help, to get in touch with me. I have listed the items that are desperately in need. I am asking your help to prioritise our order, work overtime and manufacturing the goods as soon as possible. Again, we are not asking you to donate them, we will pay for the goods. We will then post them directly to the front line hospitals in Hubei Province in China, NOT VIA ANY NGOs. Thank you very much!

We‚Äôve been collecting such supplies from various sources to ensure the safety of our PW employees and any help from you means a lot to us.  If you would like to donate, PW Shanghai team have created this page to raise money, and your donation will be used to purchase face masks and safety goggles, as well as other essential medical supplies, and ship to our PW Shanghai office ASAP, helping PW shanghai employees, their families and others in need in Wuhan, as well as contributing to the efforts of stopping the virus from taking more lives.",

Our mission is to use Chinese culture as a carrier to promote social progress and build a spiritual home for Chinese Americans. Our three focuses are based on love, inherit culture, and focusing. The first focus is love, which means we‚Äôll be organizing social events-such as fundraising, donation, teaching children living in hills--in order to spread the love to the community. The second is based on culture inheriting. As Chinese Americans, we also have projects and activities to promote Chinese culture and art. Thirdly, we will focus our spirit and mission, creating a welcoming and helpful environment/community for Chinese American students. In the future, we will be reaching out to different states and China to help plan trips, college applications, and internships.   On behalf of our Spark organization, our goal is to help Wuhan, China and we have the responsibility to help those who have been affected by this deadly virus, which is circulating all around the world. According to the New York Times, in Wuhan, there are already more than 14,000 people affected, and more than 300 have died from this severe virus. Not only in China, but the United States so far has shown 8 cases with one of which hits in the bay area. With the severity of this disease, we want to help by holding a Go-Fund-Me fundraiser to provide supplies for the affected people in Wuhan and their scarcity in medical supplies.

A scarcity of critical medical supplies such as N95 face masks, protective goggles, protective suits and other medical grade equipment is contributing to the increased number of people, including health professionals, exposed to this dangerous disease. Death tolls are rising and we must act fast!  As Chinese across Toronto Ontario Canada, we are reaching out to all of our communities, their friends and families to ask for a hand in aiding the efforts of Chinese medical professionals to combat this virus.   We have launched a fundraising for the City of Wuhan to prevent cross-infection and curb the spreading of the coronavirus. Funds raised will be used to buy necessary supplies for epidemic prevention or to be donated to other charity organizations to fight the coronavirus directly.

Government support The two institutes that discovered Shuanghuanglian's alleged ability to \"inhibit\" the coronavirus are both state-run bodies. The Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica is under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), a top government think tank. The Wuhan Institute of Virology is also¬†administered by the CAS¬†and is among the country's most advanced virus research laboratories. Thousands of people have been sickened by a new coronavirus, called 2019-nCoV, in at least a dozen countries, including the US. Coronaviruses attack the respiratory system, sometimes targeting the cells deep within the lungs. Only seven, including 2019-nCoV, SARS, and MERS, have evolved to infect humans.\r\n \r\n",

A further 24,324 people on the Chinese mainland have been infected China's National Health Commission said on Wednesday. It has now spread to the U.S and is infecting American citizens with 12 cases already confirmed.¬†   Our Mission   For the past month, China has been suffering in a new epidemic known as the coronavirus. Our goal is to raise money and buy supplies and directly send them to Chinese hospitals for use and treatment on patients due to the lack of supplies. The lack of equipment/supplies, workers, and space in hospitals is inadequate and needs to be helped ASAP. We will try to aid and try to slow down the spread of coronavirus in China because America is better suited to handle these outbreaks then China.

Some examples of equipment and supplies that we give are gloves, face masks, and more medical supplies. We will fund the hospitals so that they can get more money to expand and make rooms for their patients. The money we raise and will send to them will also be used for hiring more workers to ensure that most, if not all, of the patients, can be treated in time and not die waiting for medical help.

            "description": " Hello Everyone!  My name is Tina and I am a Chinese born Australian. I was born and raised by the very mothering land of China and as I feel the need to do something to help my motherland to overcome this terrifying Crisis!  As I work in the health care industry for the past 12 years, I travel to Chinese hospitals often, and I have a vast amount of channels to receive most up to date news. It is now WuHan hospitals that are most in demand of these medical equipments, there are more than 30k confirmed diagnosis, and much more infected. The hospitals in Wuhan are already OUT OF surgical masks and protective gowns, unfortunately, the government is also in shortage.  Your donations will be spent to purchasing N95 masks, procedural masks that has 99% bacterial filtration rate, and medical/surgical gowns which I have already sourced from. With the existing amount funded, I have already purchased (out of my own pocket for now until gofundme allows for withdrawal) 1100 procedural masks, 100 N95 masks and 50 surgical gowns. Note that there are still 350 gowns, 900 N95 masks and 4900 procedural masks available for purchase before they get sold out (which will happen in less than a couple of days), I need your support to ensure that our Chinese front line fighters are protected while they serve their patients.¬†  My friend will then bring back all these gears in person from Sydney to Beijing on 12th Feb and that is when the fundraising will stop.   Chinese Doctors and Nurses are currently treating tens of thousands of infected patients using recycled (washed in disinfectant solution) surgical masks, and lab coat‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. as there are NO MORE protective gear left for use!  So many of them are infected EVERYDAY, and then they go home and infect their family members. Every time I read a story, I am in tears‚Ä¶‚Ä¶¬†  Please chip in and help out to the first line Hero and Angels!  I thank you very much in advance! Tina  To update on the most recent progression of this activity (07Feb2020) - I have successfully sourced 1100 Procedural masks and 180 N95/P2 masks ready for shipping. - I am awaiting to receive 50 surgical gowns and am looking for more, if anyone has resources for medical equipments, please reach out to me on 0450225004.   UPDATE on 10Feb2020:   Thank you all so very much my dearest Chinese brothers and sister, together, we have made a total of almost 9000 over the past 5 days!! This is unreal!!  As many of you would have noticed, that the donation was disabled as of last night. The reason for this is because we have saturated existing stocks that we could get hold of, and the campaign needs to close prior to 11th Feb as all stocks will depart to Beijing on 13Feb.¬†  Having said that, I have obtained 2 more potential resources as of last night, and with successful establishment of both connections, and confirmed supply, the Campaign maybe reopened again, so please watch the space.  Wish me luck :)  All the very best to Chinese civilians...and hope that the outbreak will not be worsened with the end of the holiday period, today. ..",

As a Chinese, I feel so devastated everytime when I hear that another family friend passed away or another friend got infected. My mom works in the hospital and has to put her life on the line to reuse expired face masks everyday. This is why so many health care workers got infected. The infected areas are urged to use medical supplies such as face masks and protective clothes. This is now the only way to slow down the virus spread. We would like to share this conquering 2019-nCOV campaign with you  https://www.gofundme.com/f/ConqueringCOV  Your donation will be collected and used to purchase protective gear to help those infected areas and stop the virus from spreading worldwide. Your support is well appreciated.  To tell you a bit more about our fund: We are student organization at Rice Business School in Houston, TX. This Campaign has been approved and supported by Rice Jones Business School since Feb 5th 2020. We have contacted the alumni initiated group in South California that collects the fund from top universities in US to support the coronavirus in China. Attached the charity group information in the picture below. The fund will be directly transferred to the group mentioned above. The procurement team will purchase the healthcare supplies and ship back to China in the next few days once the money is received. ",

Robert has a large extended family and friends who we know will be right beside him loving and fighting with him!   ¬†Hitting the ground running they decided to start curative treatment as fast as they could. With 3 months of chemotherapy, surgery ¬†and another 3 months of Chemotherapy. He and his family will need our support and love as he embarks on this journey. There are many ways we can rally around Robert and his incredible family: prayers, meals, love and financial support.¬†    This means giving up a few things He loves and enjoys for the near future, like his job and little league. Robert has been a loyal hardworking employee for Berryessa Union School District for the last 18 years, a job which he has excelled at. He is well respected and loved at his job even being awarded employee of the year for all his hard work.¬†    Robert has since stepped down from being President of Berryessa Little League a passion of his, since his diagnosis.Robert has been an active part of little league since he first coached his daughter Rae in 2007 at North Valley. ¬†In 2008 he started coaching for Berryessa Little League where he coached all of his kids, his nephews and countless children. ¬†His loving sprit was always noticed on the field from racing the kids around the bases with 60 of his work keys clipped to his belt. Maintaining the fields for the league and at countless board meetings. If you didn‚Äôt see him coaching or working on the field you could find him umpiring games .¬†    Robert is one of the easiest people to love and friend in minutes. ¬†He is the only person I know who makes friends every single place he goes. Robert can walk into a party not knowing one person and by the end of the night he has made friends with everyone there making plans to see them again. With his outgoing and joking personality who wouldn‚Äôt want to be his new friend. He would also give the shirt off his back and if you need any help he‚Äôs the first to volunteer without you even asking. ¬†He has the ability to make you feel as if you‚Äôve known him for years even after only just minutes of knowing him.    Robert also loves his wife Rachelle who he has been with for 20 years. He‚Äôs a family man through and through You see that love and devotion in his 4 children. ¬†His family is the most important thing to him. ¬†Cancer will not stop him from doing anything and everything he can for them.   Anyone who knows Robert knows how loved he makes everyone around him feel. Through this journey Robert, Rachelle and kids will need our help. Robert and Rachelle will both be out of work during this (Robert being the main provider)and have lots of added expenses with lots of doctors visits, tests ,medicines special diet, gas and care along with their regular monthly expenses. All donations will go directly towards these things. Please help us make their next few months a little easier with one less thing to worry about. ¬†Every little bit helps and we can‚Äôt thank you enough in advance for your love and support.¬†    The road to recovery will have its ups and downs but we know that we will all rally around Robert, Rachelle and kids with any and all support we can give! ¬†    Remember rule #1 from Coach Robert. ¬†Have fun and always give 100%!!¬†     THEY WILL BEAT THIS!  ¬†   If you‚Äôd like to help support them in any other way please email chellelarae430@gmail.com   #CRONASTRONG ¬† #YOURFIGHTISOURFIGHT",

Originated in Wuhan, China, the virus has spread throughout every continent, infecting more than 75000 people with 2009 killed as of February 19, 2020. The World Health Organization has declared the virus ‚Äúa global threat.‚Äù And we need to help those in need of basic medical supplies to prevent the spread of the virus.\r\n     I want to address this issue to my home country, Vietnam, which declared the novel coronavirus outbreak an epidemic on February 01 with 16 people infected so far. Here, although many people are aware of the disease and try to take precautions, there are some ‚Äì especially THE POOR - who do not have the fair chance to access the most basic safety. Because of the virus, the cost of face masks has risen dramatically; worse still, they are out of stock in many areas due to different reasons. The situation creates a huge disadvantage for the needy. I am organizing this fund to buy masks from the U.S. and give them to the people in poor areas in Vietnam which are currently facing a huge shortage of masks.\r\n     My goal is to get $2,500 for this fund; and we need to act quickly since the price of masks is changing constanly due to the shortage. The money will then be sent to a doctor that I have contact with to buy masks; then the masks will be sent back to some friends of mine in Vietnam who will help me distribute them to poor people. To start, I will donate $200 and I hope you will act quickly as well. Thank you for your consideration.

            "description": "\r\n My name is Michael Gray and I'm homeless here in Nashville. A few weeks ago a tornado hit Nashville killing 8 homeless people as it tore through the Jefferson Street bridge homeless camp, destroying all the tents there and displacing a lot of people. Most of the resources we relied on to get by were now focused on the victims of the tornado who lost their homes; and rightfully so. \r\n \r\n\r\n Now we have the flu pandemic and we still have not recovered from the tornado. Most of the resources we depend on closed down because of the flu and we have been unable to get needed supplies now for weeks. The homeless camp I stay in has a lot of people with mental health issues who are homeless by no fault of their own. Most are unable to head into town to find help even if there was a place to go. I have been here for almost 6 months helping make sure everyone has what they need and it is now very difficult. \r\n \r\n\r\n We need supplies. Mostly water and food but we also need propane for cooking and for heat at night and batteries and flashlights. Essential items that we cannot get by without. Other problems most people don't realize we have being homeless are things like money to wash bedding and clothing and to purchase shoes, socks and new tents. If it wasn't for a few amazing people that have sent food and water, I don't know how we would have gotten by so far.\r\n \r\n\r\n If you can help, we need it. I would be able to purchase and distribute supplies where they are needed most if we had some funding, so please donate a few dollars if you are able. If not, please check on your neighbors even if you don't know them. Or ask someone who looks distressed if they need help. Because it's the right thing to do and a small act of kindness can travel through the hearts of dozens of people, and change the world. \r\n \r\n\r\n Thank you, \r\n \r\n\r\n Michael Gray - Founder of H.E.A.L. \"Helping Escape Addictive Lifestyles\" 615-541-3661 \r\n \r\n",

So she is waiting to get into an oral surgeon to see if there is anything they can do. She has been on antibiotics to clear up a chest cold or infection in her sinuses that makes her cough and labors her breathing. \r\nMom's recent pain in the area where her breast was removed was examined by a doctor who ordered more tests.

Then I think about leaving again, something I know will make me feel like an even bigger failure. During this outbreak it has left me uncertain of how I might continue to not only have a roof over my head, ¬†but cover basic needs such as food and water. The virus has stopped all schools from opening, which in turn means us teachers are left with nothing. As it stands the schools are not due to open any time soon which does mean basic living necessities will be something I no longer have access to. Food and water will no longer be a viable option, let alone having somewhere to live.¬†\r\n \r\n\r\n  All I‚Äôm asking for is help, in any way shape or form.

Since then, the numbers of those infected and died have grown exponentially, killing over 600 people with another 30,000 infected. The effects of the novel coronavirus are very evident throughout China seen with roads being blocked, major cities being quarantined, and hospitals being inundated with thousands of cases. This surplus of patients has led to an extreme shortage of supplies that are necessary for the doctors to treat the sick, including face masks, medical goggles, and hazmat suits. As this virus is relatively new, not much is known about it yet making it unpredictable and threatening.  This is why we need your help. There are over 98 million people living in the epicenter of this outbreak with no way out, making it an extremely dangerous situation for them. Even a donation of $5 is sufficient to provide aid to those on the frontlines battling the coronavirus. I have partnered with the ACP Foundation and the North Texas Hubei Association who will be able to ensure supplies can be shipped to the Hubei province as soon as possible. All proceeds will be donated towards North Texas Hubei Association who has sellers to purchase the supplies from (face masks, gloves, sanitation suits, etc.) to distribute to various hospitals in the Hubei province. This association has already delivered 10,000 medical gowns, 35,000 face masks, and 1,875 protective goggles to Hubei Province. The situation in China is worsening and they need all the aid they can receive. Please support us as we join ranks with the citizens of Wuhan and fight against the Novel Coronavirus.

            "description": "      Hello. I'm \"Jae Hoon\" living in Korea. I am poor at English.  So if you use a language machine, please understand.   Thank you.  Currently, the Wnhan coronavirus is a very large threat worldwide. It's more dangerous than the Ebola virus, which was deadly years ago. The infection is very high, and today in China, it's a deadly evolution of human-to-human infections. I didn't take it seriously because I thought it was happening in China. However, over time, many felt infected and felt that they did not look at the current situation.  I investigated, but the situation was serious.  I wanted to help China and the country of the infected. But I do not have the knowledge of making vaccines. Currently, China and countries with infected people are said to be very short of masks and hand sanitizers.  Currently, foreign traders have purchased large quantities of high-grade masks in Korea. They sell at very high prices in their own country.  The cost of a Korean mask is $ 0.25. They sell at least $ 3 to up to $ 6 in their home country. The average income of a family in China is $500 a month.  It is very unfortunate and sad.  Currently, some parts of China are isolated when they are rich or poor or not wearing masks. If the number of infected continues to increase, all countries will be in danger.  So I want to help China and the infected country and the future. I will make a mask factory with my money. I will send relief goods to every country that needs a mask for free. But I have money that only makes factories.   Start fund-raising for mask parts purchase   Please.    I do not want the situation of Wuhan Coronavirus to get worse. And help people who are poor and cannot buy masks. I will build the factory early. And I'll make a mask and send it to many countries as a relief Help me. For the country and the world. If help is difficult. Tell your friends and family about this.      Thank you for reading this long article.",

            "description": "Novel Coronavirus(2019-nCoV) is a new respiratory virus first identified in Wuhan, a big transportation hub in China. The virus is highly contagious and it's appearance during the peak of Chinese New Year has allowed it to spread to other cities. It has now passed SARS in deaths, and is several times more infectious in its spread.  As of February 9, 2020, according to the government's report in China, 40,710 people have been diagnosed with coronavirus, 23,589 people are suspected of being infected and 910 people have died.   These numbers increase every day, and there have been no signs of slowing down. It is threatening the lives of hundreds of millions not only in China, but around the world. China estimates that the peak of the infection rate will be around mid-February, the most difficult time has yet to come. In all Chinese cities, schools are delayed and all public facilities are shut down.  Due to the unexpected outbreak, hundreds of millions of Chinese people's lives are at stake.  Items such as: masks, goggles and protective suits which are used to combat the spread of this disease are high in demand but low in supply. We need your help to fight against this devastating illness.  We're working with Chicago NW suburban Chinese Christian Church which is in connection with a Wuhan Church to organize the purchase and shipment to the hospitals in need. All money raised is going to be used to purchase those medical supplies for doctors in Wuhan. With your help, we will make sure that doctors will have access to needed supplies in order to prevent the spread of the disease and save more lives.",

This is still valid but the cost to manufacture is higher and there is still a higher chance that it would not filter the virus in the placed room, or in travel before it could make contact with someone. For this reason, I would like to take the same principles and design a small personal device, that could be carried (similar to cell phone), and could be used everywhere. I need your help to bring this to reality!¬† With the proper amount of funding and moving forward with all previous work, time and money spent, I believe we can make such a device that can be affordable and practical to use everyday and SAVE LIVES!¬† ( Death toll from the CoVID-19 already at 3,043 with 88,948 infected globally )     All studies are scientifically proven and so a personal device could be as small as a can of soda, using a USB charge port/battery to provide power. This is a reboot of many years of work and concern for the health of everyone that are effected every year by the flu and then the OUTBREAKS of unknown killer viruses that come from around the world. To build such a device is the humane and practical idea that could be disseminated to everyone who is susceptible with low immunity to all airborne viruses know today. (AIDS, elderly, cancer treatment, etc.)¬†¬† I will be needing to find a smart team of design engineers (already have some concept ideas), manufacturing, developers, etc...    We need to start now, as the re-design (small device), prototype and manufacture process takes time and we need to get this personal safety device distributed to many people to STOP the spread of the virus and save lives!

            "description": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Hi ,   \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n As you have known that corona virus widely spread out in China. And now, in Vietnam, there are cases increasingly and there having people get isolated even though we could not know how many as an exact number have died. From the countryside and uplifted areas of Vietnam, there are a lot of the poor. It is actually hard for them to survive if there aren‚Äôt enough medical supplies and food. I am afraid in the coming days the Corona virus could able to spread out. As you know that my hometown-Vietnam is one of low growth countries, they don‚Äôt have foods, medicine or even medical supply or even the hospital to secure the patient as Chinese people did. I don‚Äôt want to see my home country Vietnam will become the second center of disease outbreak in the upcoming days. It is sympathy for the death in China and it is heartbroken since I know that one day it can able happen in Vietnam in near future because my country is having lack of foods medical supplies, and many of poor in uplifted areas and countryside are facing dealing with many difficulties. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  I watched videos everyday, I felt heartbroken to know in China the number of death increases everyday and can not count how many the number of people and places getting infections. I think that it would happen in Vietnam soon. I think I may do something other than just seat and watch videos. I want to do something to help other people in my hometown. I want to give hand to help others prevent this disease because I knew that they need our help. I think I have to do something other than just scowl in silence.¬†\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  My family is Catholic, my mom and my dad told me pray for the disease everyday. Yes, of course, I do pray everyday, I pray for the health of the world. I knew praying is necessary but still not enough to prevent the epidemic from spreading and harsh, I need to do something more realistic. That is a reason why I make this fundraiser because I hope I could able to receive some fund in order to buy more foods, medicine and medical supplies for the poor people in Vietnam.   Everybody have a dream, yes, they are now dream of being cured in times of danger. China is now a center of the disease. Vietnam is close to China if Vietnam is going to be an outbreak, it will break out in the coming days. Wealthy China still has the ability to cope, and Vietnam is a slow-growing poor country, poor people will be miserable. For those people who live in the countryside, the uplifted the highland areas are the people who need to help because their life is still hungry, torn clothes, let alone plague. They do not have the means to cope with the Corona disease. They need food, medicine and medical supplies to prepare for the coming disease. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Yes, counting people in sickness in one country is tough. We can do math here, it is hard to imagine if we can count how many country have their residents involved to the sickness and from there, it spread out to other relatives and community, number would be increased. Please do math again, we can multiply them together, get any number you want. Next, for rich country they can able to secure them or have enough food and medical supply to help the patient, but with poor country, there will be more people die in silence and the virus could be able to widespread. I feel sad if I keep continue to multiple them again and again...I have thought that is there are any way to stop the spreading. I just cannot imagine which is the better way to help them, but I knew that they need our help sooner. I think the more we try stoping spread out of Corona disease sooner is the more better for everybody surround and better for also other country near by.     ¬†\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Last but not least, I hope I can have your helping hand. I will use all this donation for the charity - getting more foodstuffs and medical supply for the poor in Vietnam. I am appreciated for any help that you could make. Please save the poor Vietnam on preventing the Corona Virus. We need your help in the near future. Please¬†save  Vietnam on preventing the Corona diseases.

Its given us the opportunity to build great personal and professional relationships.¬† It is our home and the people of Hong Kong are our community.¬†  The coronavirus has spread to HK and the exact course it will take is unknown. Currently, the focus of many HK citizens is prevention and the ability to take care of themselves and their family. There has been a run on basic supplies, lack of supplies and retailers who take advantage by price gauging. Some call this survival instincts, hysteria and others think it's fueled my rumors. Either way, the reality is people gain peace of mind when they have reserves of necessities and others simply do not have the means to procure them.  My family and I were able to leave HK before the virus spread and receive daily requests to send supplies from the US back. Many of the requests come from work colleagues, other factory owners and my own China workers/team.  The main requests are:  Face Masks - basic surgical and N95¬† Hand Sanitizer Antibacterial Wipes - for hands and home Lysol Disinfectant Spray¬† Toilet Paper¬†  We purchased a lot of supplies ourselves but ask our friends and community to help in our ability to do more. We hope through fund raising we can purchase larger quantities and more frequently ship items back by Fedex (USPS suspended shipping to HK/China).  None of the items purchased through fund raising will be put to personal use. We will disseminate the products to the families of our factory workers , local cleaners, the elderly (drop off at local elderly homes and centers) and charities who help those with limited financial means.  We truly appreciate all the support, concern and love.",

[Photo above shows the latest global picture of the spread of the COVID-19 (coronavirus) as of February 10, 2020 ]   Many hospitals in regions of China are experiencing a shortage of medical protective supplies, putting medical workers at risk and possibly contributing to the spread of the infection.  The students of the International Public Policy and Management (IPPAM) Program at the USC Price School of Public Policy seek to galvanize public support to assist medical workers in China, who are on the frontlines in caring for patients.¬† Quick action now can have an impact on assisting hospitals and medical providers in China.  We have been in contact with the Shanghai and Jiangsu Center of Disease Control, who have provided a list of medical supplies (surgical masks, N95 and protective suits) needed by hospitals in their jurisdictions and who have agreed to distribute supplies sent to them.¬† We have also contacted manufacturers of supplies such as surgical masks in a number of countries who can ramp up production to increase the shipment of supplies to China.¬† We have contacted international and local logistics companies to help in the transport of the supplies.  We are launching a fundraising campaign on Go Fund Me.¬† The funds will be used to facilitate the purchase and transport of medical protective supplies that will be distributed to hospitals in China.¬†  As global citizens, we recognize that epidemics, natural disasters and strife can strike anywhere. We believe that those outside of the crisis zone should come to the aid of those in need. We are part of an educational program that has many students and alumni from China. This is a time when we can let them know that we stand with them as they work to contain the epidemic. We hope that you will join us. Time is of the essence.¬† Please give what you can.  You will be able to track our efforts on the Go Fund Me page and on our social media sites.   We are in discussion with an NGO to jointly launch this campaign in order to have tax dedectible for every donor, which will take some time. As soon as we add this NGO in, we will let everyone know this good new. ",

In the meantime, one can only imagine how difficult it must be for some dancers in the Far East to dance, find work, and even continue to survive in the current conditions. ¬†Some of them have lost all their work and income completely. ¬†Studios are being closed down. ¬†They are struggling to not only earn enough money but to even just stay healthy as some are even fighting the deadly virus. ¬†These people, these dancers, are our colleagues, students, and friends. ¬†They are suffering and struggling to survive!  We, at the WDC Competitors Commission as well as the WDC and WDCAL, would like to ensure that we do everything we can to help our fellow colleagues and dancers in the Far East. ¬†We would have set up this GoFundMe page to help our fellow dancers in the Far East and we want to encourage our friends, patrons, vendors, suppliers, and colleagues from around the world to pull together and help one another in overcoming this crisis. ¬†We are asking everyone to extend your hand and support for our fellow dancers. ¬†Your donation will be a great help for the dancers that have been affected the most by this deadly virus in the epidemic city of Wuhan and other neighboring affected cities in the Hubei Province. ¬†  Your donations will be greatly appreciated and all donations will go to the NDC of China, a member organization of the World Dance Council, for distribution to those dancers that need it the most. ¬†Any donation will go a long way for those greatly affected by this terrible virus! We at the WDC CC would like to thank you for your time, consideration, and support for your fellow dancer!  The Management Committee of the WDC Competitors Commission   ",

            "description": "The current NCP (Novel coronavirus pneumonia) epidemic in China has caused tens of thousands of infections. As of February 11th, there were 42,715 confirmed infections and 1,017 deaths, and number of confirmed and suspected cases has increased by more than 5,000 every day. Wuhan is the largest outbreak area in China, however, the total geographic area affected by the virus encompasses approximately 70% of the county at present. And the number of infected people in various provinces across China is increasing.   ¬†  Since the outbreak of pneumonia (which is caused by the coronavirus), Shenyang City, as the center of Liaoning Province, is implementing a centralized treatment program for patients with corona virus-related pneumonia in Shenyang and 7 surrounding cities. And the Chinese government also remains at the forefront of efforts to contain the current epidemic prevention, as well. Together with the medical community (hospitals and physicians) and Chinese citizens, the government of China is aggressively working to curb the spread of the virus and protect everyone‚Äôs health. Everyone should continue to work together to help eradicate this public health threat. ¬†  The medical community is also taking steps to maximize the supply of available protective clothing and sanitary masks; however, demand for these items currently exceeds available supply. In order to improve prevention and control of the epidemic, several key hospitals in Liaoning Province have put forth proposals to all sectors of the society, asking for domestic and international assistance by donating urgently needed protective garments and masks to Liaoning Province.   As a Liaoning native living here in the United States, Mr. Ming Li has been working to help provide protective medical garments and masks for the people in his hometown, as well as for medical staff members. Thanks to everyone‚Äôs assistance, the first batch of N95 protective masks and medical protective clothing are already on their way to China.   Primary protective healthcare materials include:   ¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† N95 mask (International Standard: ISO22609:2005, American Standard: NIOSH, N95/N99 + Fluid resistant, European Standard: EN14683-2005, Chinese Standard: GB19083-2010)  ¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Protective Eyewear (elastic wear (compatible with myopia), wide field of vision, splash-proof function, without ventilations, such as: 3M 1623AF)  ¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Protective Clothing (International Standard: ISO22609:2004, American Standard: ASTMF1671-A, SH 42 CFR84; ANSI/AAMI, EU Standard: EN14126, Chinese Standard: GB 19082) ¬† We continue to need donations to provide desperately needed medical supplies to all affected areas in China.¬† All donations will strictly be used to purchase medical supplies and provide shipping costs for sending to key hospitals in Liaoning Province, such as:  ¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The Sixth People‚Äôs Hospital of Shenyang (Liaoning Infectious Disease Hospital)  ¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University  ¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Shengjing Hospital Affiliated to China Medical University ¬† Please help us with your generous donations and we‚Äòll continue to do our best to provide the assistance needed to help everyone who has been affected by this event.

My friends and I have been wanting to do something, to protect the people that are fighting the virus in the hospital, and to protect individual from getting infected.

Tianyou Hospital is a designated hospital for coronavirus. (We have contacted the hospital and confirmed that they are in shortage of the protective clothing we could provide).   While unfortunately we  have not been able to find protective suits that would meet the highest requirements for use by ICU staff ,  these suits will go to protect other hospital workers who is facing the risk . Those suits meet  the specification of GB19082-2009 (Chinese official standard), and manufacturer‚Äôs qualification has been verified by the receiving hospital.¬† My friends and I will be donating 200 suits, and I would like to invite anyone else who would like to contribute to donating more units.

Today, as of 08.20 Jakarta time, there were 44,911 cases infected with Corona Virus, 1,114 of whom died, and 4,699 others were declared recovered. It was based on data compiled by Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CCSE).  If calculated from the previous day, today has added 1,770 new cases that have been infected, claimed 96 lives, and 359 people have been cured.  Based on data released by WHO yesterday: In Singapore, there were 47 cases of someone infected with the Corona Virus, 23 of whom were traced to have a travel history from China. Whereas in the Philippines there were 3 cases and 1 person died because of this virus. Then in other nearby countries of Indonesia: 15 cases in Malaysia, 15 Australia, 33 Thailand, and 15 Vietnam.  World Health Organization (WHO) Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus confirmed that 42,708 confirmed patients were located in China. A total of 1,017 people in the country have died due to Corona Virus. The highest mortality rate is in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.  \"Outside of China, there are 393 cases in 24 countries, and 1 death,\" Ghebreyesus said yesterday.  Ghebreyesus asserted, since yesterday, the number of deaths has exceeded a thousand. He warned of the global threat of death from the Corona Virus, potentially worse than terrorism.  \"Viruses can have stronger consequences than any terrorist act,\" he said.  The Indonesian government, until now still claims that no Corona Virus has been detected in the country. Minister of Health Terawan Agus Putranto asserted, until now the filtering pattern carried out has been in accordance with international standards.  \"Everything has been checked. Our equipment has been fixed yesterday with the US Embassy, ‚Äã‚Äãwe are using kits (equipment) from America,\" Terawan said yesterday.",

My wife was not able to leave on the evac flight, because she is a Chinese citizen who only has a tourist visa and not a green card.¬† In addition, her father is infected with the corona virus and she wanted to stay to take care of him. Since we arrived in the US, his condition have seriously declined.¬† His oxygen level plummeted to 70, from 99 just two days before.¬† ¬†We are waiting for CT scans, but we were told he is dying.¬† The hospitals won't admit him to the intensive care unit because there are no beds available.¬†¬†  Three months ago, we lost her mother to a massive stroke.¬† This is just too much for us, especially my wife and son, who constantly asks where \"Nai Nai\" is (grandma). If the worst happens, my wife would not be able to hold a traditional funeral, as bodies are immediately sequestered and cremated, without the family being around.¬†¬†  We hope that with this money, we can help pay our bills in America for Emmanuel and I.¬† The quarantine is free, but flights out of California to family in the East coast is very expensive, as was the 3,600 dollar trip from China.¬† We also hope to be able to get my wife here with us.¬† I can't imagine her going through another funeral, all alone this time. We hope to use the funds to pay for our expenses here in American, but also to send much needed supplies to my wife in China.¬† Roads and public transport in the city are closed and medication is extremely hard to get a hold of.¬† Even face masks are being sold one per person. Now that my baby is safe, my concern is making things easier for my wife, as much as possible.¬† We miss her dearly and I know what she is going through with her father, without her family to support her, is destroying here.¬† I don‚Äôt know what to do, but I want to try anything I can. With your donations, I hope to be able to pay for these unexpected expenses. These include repaying the US government 3,600 dollars for the flight to New York, additional flights to my families home in Philadelphia, clothing for my three year old (we were told to pack light and the weather where we live is much warmer than in Philadelphia ). In addition, since Chinese banks only issue one bank card per account, we decided my wife should keep it so she can pay for medical bills there, but food, pay rent, etc. As such, paying for necessities here in America will be a challenge. Also, in the unfortunate occurrence that my son and I need medical care (I take prescription medicine) my insurance is not valid in the United States. Finally, we hope to be able to fly my wife to America, to reunite our family Thank you for taking the time to read this and thank you for any donation you may give.",

It‚Äôs a very rewarding and exciting job- that is when the COVID-19 aka Corona Virus doesn‚Äôt force the schools to close. The information about the closures has come to the public schools within a days‚Äô notice one week at a time. It has been proposed by Ho Chi Minh city that schools could stay closed until April. I am on forced unpaid leave and it is likely going to last 2 months.¬† During this time of uncertainty we don‚Äôt know until when as the information comes out at the last minute.  ¬†I really miss teaching my students and guiding them to enjoy learning English through games, activities, and prizes.     Since I can‚Äôt teach my students due to the forced shut down, I would like to do something more useful and meaningful with my time. Instead of hiding from the Virus in my little apartment in Hanoi for another month, I‚Äôve decided to try and make the most of my time to go back to volunteering for a bit. So, I am asking if anyone would like to help me make it to Nepal/ or the Philippines, wherever the need is the greatest and cheapest to volunteer. ¬†  ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† I am 100% committed to using my skills and time volunteering during this break so I will make whatever I get work! So, every dollar, penny, dong, like, share, or positive message you can share, whatever you can throw my way counts! I have already been approved to go volunteer so now I just need to get there!!! Thank you for reading/sharing  3  Some of the cost include the transportation, visa, food/accommodations, and some materials needed. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask!",

Her vehicle overturned and is now a complete loss. She was in the vehicle with her youngest son Jovanni Miraculously, my nephew was not physically hurt as of now but we worry about psychological well being, but Jackie was not quite so lucky. She suffered a dislocated shoulder, broken collarbone, shattered elbow, broken ribs and extensive damage to her hand and fingers. She has undergone several hours of surgery to save her fingers, which at one point they thought they would have to amputate. She will undergo more surgeries this coming week and will also require physical therapy. She currently remains in the ICU unit. Her husband is the only one employed at this time but Jackie would like him by her side, which is understandable. I created this Go Fund Me account to raise funds to help with her family with medical bills, expenses and child care. We are unsure at this time when she will return to work. Please help us by donating or sharing this post with friends and family members. We thank you very much for your support during these hard times.\r\n \r\n\r\n    \r\n ",

Let's stop this extremely sad situation while we can!  --   As more and more  reports¬π   begin¬≤ ¬† to  emerge¬≥ ¬† (as well as devastating  videos‚Å¥ ¬†) of the massive amount of animal cruelty happening in China as a result of the panic surrounding the Coronavirus outbreak. With the amount of attention given to the human victims and preventative efforts, it's a crucial time to give attention to the situation affecting animals as well.  Warning: Graphic Image Below    In addition to the (currently) 70,000+ person confirmed cases, reports of thousands of pets being affected as a result of the scare. People are leaving homes quickly and abandoning their pets resulting in starvation and accidental deaths. Even more shocking are the reports (and graphic videos) of the slaying of stray animals in a disgustingly misguided effort to limit the spread of the virus.  Warning: Graphic Image Below    Since the vast majority of the current efforts are focused on the human victims and preventative efforts, we've organized a plan with local volunteers already in the Hubei province and surrounding areas. Money from this fundraiser will be used for food, shelter, and caretaking for animals in the most affected areas.      We only share these devastating photos to shine light on the current reality of the situation which isn't being given much attention.",

Helping people in Wuhan, the epicentre of the deadly coronavirus outbreak to contain the spread of the epidemic is helping ourselves.  A plague at such scale would be disastrous for any city in the world. All hospitals in Wuhan reported low stock on medical supplies as they are experiencing an unprecedented patients intake each day.  Frontline healthcare professionals and first responders, amidst the lunar New Year holiday, are working 24/7 to treat the sick, save lives and bring this outbreak under control. They skip meals and washroom breaks in order to save on disposal of protective coveralls.  The emerging, rapidly evolving situation touches the hearts of billions of people worldwide.  This coronavirus relief campaign aims to provide desperately needed medical supplies such as masks, hazmat suits and gloves to the frontline healthcare workers and hospitals in Wuhan, to help prevent the spread of the virus.  To date, 40,000 pairs of gloves and 10,000 isolation gowns are en route to Wuhan. Protective goggles, impact-proof masks and hazmat suits worth $25,000 are being purchased.  We are proud to announce our partnership with the Crackup Ottawa Comedy Festival! A portion of their ticket sales for DASHAN AND FRIENDS on Thursday, March 26 and CRACKUP OTTAWA FESTIVAL FINALE on Friday, March 27 will be donated to our coronavirus relief. Details of the events can be found here -   http://www.crackup.ca/events  .  Crackup Ottawa will also be promoting our ‚ÄúGoFundMe‚Äù campaign with the goal of raising an additional $100,000 in private and corporate donations from the Ottawa and Canadian comedy community.",

As a Chinese, I feel the need to help my people in need.¬† As you all know, the Corona Virus disease has claimed the lives of over 1000 people and over 70,000 people are affected with the numbers going up every single day.  Hospitals in Wuhan are running out of medical supplies and the money donated will go towards hardworking medical staff who are risking their lives to help fight the virus and victims affected by the deadly virus. It will also go towards buying protective supplies from around the world and send it to hospitals in Wuhan and all the small cities in the Hubei province. for patients and medical workers to ensure they are safe and protected from the virus.¬†  The money donated will go into buying N95 masks from different places around the world, these masks will go to medical workers and people in Wuhan and the other small cities in the Hubei province, those people have less access to medical supplies but the virus there is just as deadly.¬†  The masks will also go to regular citizens in Wuhan and Hubei province who may not have enough money to buy masks as many sellers have raised the price of face masks when people need them most to ridiclously high prices.  You may not know this but Hospitals in Wuhan right now are a living hell, hospitals have run out of beds for patients and medical supplies like masks are running low. People are collapsing in hospital hallways and medical workers are working hours non stop to save lives. Doctors and nurses and other medical staff have been infected by the virus and are dying every single day.  Even a bit of your money can help those people in desperate need, although this might not affect your daily lives, people in Wuhan are in a living hell right now. As humans, we must stick together during tough times and together we can help fight this virus.¬†  If you cannot donate, please share this around and help spread awareness, thank you for your kindness and willingness to help.

(cnn.com) Wuhan suffered a considerable loss, China and the world focused on Wuhan. Lots of resources are shipped to Wuhan. However, besides Wuhan, the other small cities in Hubei province also suffered the impacts from the coronavirus. The growing number of patients and questioning cases put significant pressure on the hospitals of the smaller cities. Comparing to Wuhan, these cities are in shortage of medical resources. They need help from us!  Xiangyang has 5.6 million population, has confirmed 441 coronavirus patients. Because there are not enough testing equipment and medical resources, a lot of suspected patients have to isolate themselves home. Now, we are working with Xiangyang Integration of Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine Hospital, which was appointed as the coronavirus patient treatment hospital on 01/25/2020. My friend Xinhui Gao and I (Zijing Zhu) contacted a medical worker in the hospital. They are still in the condition of lacking the essential medical supplies such as masks, surgical goggles, and protective suits. We want to do what we can to help the situation, and your generous contribution will help the hospital to acquire the medical necessities. We hope that our donation will help beat the coronavirus!

            "description": "Dear all,  The Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is now rapidly spreading throughout China. As of February 10th 2020 , 40,265 persons were confirmed of being diagnosed with the 2019-nCoV, with 909 deaths so far. As time goes, the confirmed case dramatically emerged in Henan Province, as of February 10th (Henan local time) 1073 cases were confirmed with 6 deaths and 187 cures. In the fight against the pneumonia epidemic of the new coronavirus infection, the biggest challenge is the shortage of medical supplies/consumables which are the key to protect medical service providers, including thousands of doctors and nurses who are doing their best to resuscitate patients in critical conditions and save the lives of infected patients, some patients are their peer doctors/nurses who were unfortunately sickened by this disease. We witness that they were fighting relentlessly in dangerous situations to help cure Chinese patients and to control the spread of this contagious disease from infecting more people outside of China.   Henan University Alumni Association in the United States would like to unite our efforts to provide stronger help and charity support to the hospitals and patients in Henan Province, with the hope to save more lives and prevent doctors/nurses being affected by the virus with more needed resources.  We are here to sincerely call on for any support and contribution in any format, i.e. funds, medical supplies/consumables, medical resources and support, and so forth. Our overseas fundraising channel is now open and all-out efforts are being made to open overseas materials transportation and fundraising channels, we will ensure your support and funds are transferred to the people in need.  We appeal to all people with kindness and love. Please join us in making an impact and your help will be highly appreciated.   Plan on how to use funds: With the funds raised, we are going to purchase medical consumables in urgent needs as the following: Surgical mask, Medical N95 Mask, safety goggles, protective eyewear, protective cap, medical protective suit, etc.   We will purchase medical consumables in USA, then coordinate with major airlines to ship all materials/supplies to Henan Province in China. Charity funds and resources will be donated to the major hospitals in the cities of Xinyang, Nanyang, Zhumadian, Zhengzhou and many more in Henan Province which are more in urgent needs.   Updates and photos on how the charity funds are used and where your donation goes will be updated on this website. Our alumni will announce the fundraising amount in real time and ensure that all the funds received be used properly and at donors' wish to better prevent the epidemic from further spreading.¬†  With your help, we firmly believe that we will definitely succeed in this fight against 2019-CoronaVirus!

Wuhan and at least 15 other cities (including Huanggang, Huangshi, Jingzhou, Yichang, ... ) have been quarantined as China attempts to halt the spread of the coronavirus. That's more than 50 million people on lockdown. Plenty of stress but shortage of everything else for these cities. There are not enough hospitals and not enough beds, not enough doctors and not enough nurses, not enough rubber gloves and not enough face masks. Millions of people are suffering from infections, panic attacks, and even death in these lockdown cities. Things are worst in many small cities.¬†  Lots of families are faced with the difficult task of recovery and reconstruction after disaster. Many of them lost their family members during outbreak. Many of them have serious after-effects of a disaster, especially for children and young people.¬† Many of them are devastated by the coronavirus . They need help. They need our support.¬†  Let's help China defeat 2019-nCov.¬† We will continue to help persons in affected areas of China (Wuhan and other seriously affected cities) to overcome this crisis and build back their life. We believe unity is strength; we beliveve faith will overcome panic attacks; and we believe we can win the battle against the virus.¬†  The donations will be used to purchase medical supplies for medical staff and people who are fighting against the 2019-nCoV in Wuhan and other cities.

            "description": "We are getting married! As we learn how to plan a wedding, we found out that we should have a registry for our guests. While we could easily put together a long list, we also noticed that none of the items on the wish list matter to us that much. The items that we would put on a registry will make our life marginally better such as a nice vacuum or a new watch, however, we believe that your money could be used in more meaningful ways - such as saving lives.¬†   Since the outbreak of the coronavirus in Wuhan, more than 70,000 people have been infected and more than 1,500 have died globally, making it a more damaging epidemic than SARS.¬†   In one local hospital in Wuhan, nearly 3 in 10 patients are health professionals, according to a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association ( link ).¬†   Among the health professionals who are fighting against the virus, many have to   work for extended hours and isolate themselves from their families for weeks. All of these are happening whilst there's a severe shortage of basic medical supplies such as surgical masks and protective clothing. Many doctors have to reuse protective goggles that are meant for single-use and use tapes to DIY their protective clothing ( NYTimes ¬†).    Figure: A vigil in Hong Kong for Dr. Li Wenliang who died from the coronavirus. He was among the first 8 doctors to alarm the public about the outbreak but he was initially accused by the local authority as a rumormonger. (Anthony Wallace/AFP via Getty Images)  To honor their sacrifice, we have decided to start this fundraising initiative. All funds gathered by March 15 will be donated to Wuhan University Alumni Association to support the local hospitals and medical professionals who are risking their lives combatting the outbreak. This particular organization is selected because of its outstanding performance during this epidemic. It has raised over $700,000 with its own fundraising initiative ( link ¬†) and is providing constant updates on the spending of the money. Although it will definitely take more than one wedding fundraising initiative to conquer this outbreak, we would like to be a small part of the solution and we invite you to join us. We really appreciate your support.  Note: If by the time we finish the fundraising, the virus has been eliminated or mitigated to a level that there is no need to donate to local hospitals or if no reliable logistic channels can be used to deliver the supplies, we plan to use this money to help with local students who are affected by this virus outbreak.",

I am a member of a core research team that focuses on Osteosarcomas, Multiple Myeloma, and the NK Cell-Based Immunotherapy, together with the Tumor Immunology of various other cancers. I¬†have co-authored and published several scientific research papers in a number of peer-reviewed journals. \r\n\r\nTowards the ending of January just before the Chinese New Year, I left China for what should have been a short travel to Malaysia. Within two days, I learned that there was an outbreak of a novel coronavirus in the Wuhan province. The worst was yet to come as three days later, the now named 2019-nCOV had virtually spread to all provinces in China and resulted in several deaths. \r\n\r\nAt this point, my program coordinator had made contact and informed me that based on the worsening situation of the now viral epidemic, I could not return to China and that I should extend my travel for a few more days until given notice to return. \r\n\r\nAbout a week later I again attempted to return but was informed that there were travel restrictions and a partial shutdown implemented by several provincial governments in addition to a number of airline cancellations and that I was not allowed to return under any circumstances until notified to do so by the University. Failure to abide by the preventative measures implemented by the educational department and the government to slow the spread of the viral outbreak would result in serious disciplinary action being taken.\r\n\r\nSince then, I have been stuck alone in a foreign country waiting and hoping each day that the situation will somehow get better, and I would be allowed to return to China as I was unable to travel elsewhere due to travel bans imposed by a number of countries. Already having spent several weeks here with still no clear sign as to when I will be able to return, I again queried and was notified that courses would be conducted online for the period, and I should return home until notice is given for the resumption of regular classes/rotations. Thereafter, depending on the progress of the situation, I can apply in advance to return, providing that the outbreak is under control.\r\n\r\nPlease, if able to donate to help me stay afloat until I can return home as well as help with travel expenses I would be grateful. I have depleted all my resources and will try traveling to Jamaica soon. \r\nThanks in advance. I appreciate your kind assistance.\r\nIf you wish to see some of my published research articles, you may visit  https://www.mendeley.com/profiles/ramone-a-williamson/ ",

            "description": "\r\n    Please consider donating ASAP as this is an urgent issue!  WHO declares the 2019-nCoV a GLOBAL EMERGENCY \r\n \r\n\r\n  Hi, we are Richard Z. and Katherine H. from Mountain View High School in Mountain View, CA. We are just students who want to help in an ongoing world issue.  As you may know already, the China coronavirus, known medically as the 2019-nCoV is currently spreading rapidly in China, and hospitals in Wuhan, the epicenter of this virus, are flooded with patients while not having enough medical supplies. The image is a letter from  The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University , asking for help from the public to donate  N95 respiratory masks, surgical masks, as well as hazardous material suits , with a certified government seal. The president of the Chinese Medical Association who works at  the Guangzhou Medical University , Zhong Nanshan, played a big role in controlling the outbreak of the 2003 SARS virus. He is also a leading scientist and researcher in this 2019-nCoV virus.  Currently the supply for these medical equipments in China are depleting quickly, as thousands of people a day rush to hospitals just for basic flu-like symptoms. The government has also sent medical professionals from this hospital by military plane to Wuhan to help stop the surprisingly contagious pandemic. Hospitals are filled with chaos, with not much to do and filled with patients to infect others, some which may have no problem with them at all. Sadly, the virus appeared during the Lunar New Year season, which means that people in the city return to their rural homes. Wuhan, a city of 12 million people, may have had much more infected people than the numbers posted by the Chinese government, and is most likely more widespread, as 5 million people left the epicenter of the outbreak just before they locked down.  We will  use your donations to purchase medical supplies and ship them to this hospital (The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University) , which will either ship them to hospitals in Wuhan, or use them as infection numbers increase. Richard's mother, Dr. Qiu, works at this hospital, and  the location is a certified donation point by the Chinese government . Anything is helpful. Please help us battle this virus together before it spreads to the places around you. Thank you.  For questions about this fundraiser, please feel free to contact us using the \"contact\" button down below. We will give you a response as soon as we can.    \r\n ",

I was born and raised by the very mothering land of China and my home town Wuhan, as I feel the need to do something to help my motherland to overcome Novel Coronavirus ‚Äì COVID19.  As of today there are more than 74,576 people confirmed diagnosis and more than 2000 people died, predominantly (over 90%) in my home town Wuhan. The hospitals in Wuhan are already OUT OF Surgical masks, Protective overalls and Protective Eyewear/Goggles.  Doctors and Nurses are currently treating tens of thousands of infected patients using recycled (washed in disinfectant solution) surgical masks, and lab coat or even rain coat‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. as there are NO MORE protective gear left for use!  Your donations will be spent to purchasing Surgical Masks, Protective Overalls for medical/surgical and Protective Goggles which I have already sourced from. With the existing amount funded, I have already purchased (out of my own pocket for now until gofundme allows for withdrawal) 100 Surgical masks, 50 Protective overalls. Note that there are still 450 surgical overalls, 4900 surgical masks and 500 Protective Goggles available for purchase before they get sold out, I need your support to ensure that our Chinese front line fighters are protected while they serve their patients.¬†  Please chip in and help out to the first line Hero and Angels!  ¬†All purchasing medical supplies will be sent to HuBei Charity Federation located in Wuhan TianHe airport, and they will distribute to the hospital(s) in Wuhan or other city in HuBei .  I thank you very much in advance!  Vanessa  Update:¬† Our team have already bought four cartons (180 suits) Type 3 protective overalls and sent to Wuhan on 24 of Feb with China Southern airline. Please watch 7News Sydney¬† \"China Southern Airline mercy plane carrying humanitarian and and bound directly for Wuhan has taken off from Sydney Airport on 24th of February\"  Update (10/03/20): there were 14 cartons Protective Overalls (420 suits) being bought and will be sent by China Southern Airline mercy plane on 16/03/20.",

            "description": "Visit our website:  www.georgetowncovid19.com ¬†  We are a group of students from Georgetown University, and we are fundraising for medical supplies and devices to support hospitals in China to assist patients infected by or under the threat of COVID-19.   Why are we doing this fundraiser?  The SARS-CoV-2 virus (previously known as the 2019 novel coronavirus) has permeated our news and conversations for the past month. Yet, no news can rightfully communicate the fear, confusion, and helplessness of those that are infected or quarantined, nor the courage and sacrifice of the doctors, nurses, and volunteers battling on the frontline. Many Georgetown students have families in China and Wuhan. They are worried and have contributed a lot of time and effort to help their families and others in China.   As students of Georgetown University, we are guided by the Jesuit tradition of Cura Personalis -- ‚Äúcare for the whole person‚Äù, and believe that it is part of our responsibility to help the members of the global community who are most severely affected by the COVID-19 global pandemic.   Therefore, we are holding this fundraiser to achieve two goals: 1. To provide funds that alleviate the immediate medical needs of Chinese hospitals on the frontline of fighting the coronavirus.  2. To empower members of the Georgetown community in making an impact on the fight against this global pandemic.    Where are the proceeds going?  The proceeds of this fundraiser will go to  Beijing Chunmiao Charity Foundation . We chose them because of their demonstrated quickness to respond, their proven ability to obtain medical supplies and devices to hospitals in need, and their emphasis on operational transparency.  Links to learn more:  Description of Chunmiao in English   About Chunmiao's coronavirus project  (can be translated using Chrome browser)  Chunmiao is a Chinese non-profit founded in 2010 specializing in public welfare projects in caring for congenitally-ill children, healthcare, education, elderly-nursing, and poverty alleviation.  On January 27, 2020, Chunmiao formed a Coronavirus workgroup that was able to raise roughly 40M RMB (roughly 6M USD), more than 25M RMB of which is already spent to provide medical supplies and devices to hospitals in Wuhan and surrounding areas.  Chunmiao will decide the specific usage of our proceeds as they see fit (e.g. masks vs. ECMO machines) to the circumstances of the hospitals they support.    Fundraiser disclosure  Given that Chunmiao is non-profit registered in China only (meaning it cannot register itself on GoFundMe), we will transfer the proceeds to a personal account first before wiring them to Chunmiao's account in China.  Stanley He ¬†, a current MBA student at Georgetown and the liaison between Chunmiao and us, will receive the proceeds and then wire them out.  We will be disclosing all financial transactions and records related to this fundraiser and obtain a receipt from Chunmiao. Chunmiao will also provide us a report on the usage of our donation to us. We are in the process of setting up a website to disclose this information.¬†   Members and friends of the Georgetown community, we hope to get your support to come together and help fight this global pandemic by supporting the people who are fighting the coronavirus and saving lives on the frontline.

I am writing to you all today, because he managed to get out of the house and was caught by the pound.¬† You would think this is an easy fix, but unfortunately it is not. The pound will not release him to us, unless we pay for the impound, the board, any vaccination and license. And none of it is cheap. Usually after a certain amount of days they would put him up for adoption, but this is not the case either. One of his hip bones is not fully developed and he can't walk properly, and because he doesn't qualify \"esthetically\" he can't be adopted. Which is unjust and awful. And if he can't be adopted... they have to put him down... he is a beautiful creature, please help, anything helps, just because he's imperfect doesn't mean he doesn't have the right to live:/",

Worldwide over 1400 cases have been reported since the virus was first diagnosed in Wuhan on January 15, less than 10 days ago.¬† These numbers are likely low, as individuals who have sent texts and emails from the region have reported that in some cases, because there are so many people going to the hospitals and there is not enough staff, people are just being sent home. Hospitals are over flowing in cases,¬† running low or have no supplies of to offer supportive care and are lacking protective gear to protective their medical staff and contain and isolate infected cases.¬†  As of today, Wuhan and many other cities within the province have been quarantined. ¬† At least 17 cities within the province have been locked down. Individuals are not allowed to leave the cities, by plane, train, or any other means.¬† Hospitals are overwhelmed and the Chinese government is building two emergency hospitals within the city. All public transportation within the city has been shutdown.¬† Starting Sunday, use of private vehicles within the city will be banned.  Wuhan‚Äôs need for medical assistance is severe.¬† As the epicenter, with over 11 million people, the lack of adequate medical protection means that even those healthy individuals and the medical staff who are there to care for them are at great risk.¬† It may seem that this is a ‚ÄúChina problem, not a U.S. problem,‚Äù but if the Coronavirus outbreak is not addressed now, by the time it reaches the same level of urgency in the U.S., it will have already reached emergency levels around the globe.¬† We need to help China address the Coronavirus.  We are looking to send the following medical supplies, namely, surgical masks (N95 mask, YY 0469-2010), goggles to cover the entire face, disposable medical gloves, medical caps, shockproof eye masks, protective clothing (3M 4565), medical protective masks (GB 19083-2010).¬† If you can donate these supplies, or donate money for us to purchase them, or have connections for AMPSAA to appeal directly, such help will be greatly appreciated. Please forward this to whomever you think can help. Thank you!",

            "description": "I was born in a country with an outdated educational system, a childhood of many incidents, and was a victim of crime. One day I decided that I only lived once, i had to live my own life, so i escaped. No one who knows me for the past 6 years knows my past, knows what I have suffered and overcome, alone. I have just started my own life for 6 years, from absolutely nothing. It took 6 years for me to build a life of my own.  Since i was a child, my dream is to become an artist. After 6 years of hard work to build a minimum life of a human being, I borrow money to study art and planned to use my monthly salary to pay off the loan. Its the bank that the company paying salary for employees through. The loan was deducted directly from my monthly salary.  Unfortunately, the COVID-19 epidemic occurred in December 2019, and the tourism industry in my country (an Indochina country, not China) is badly damaged, while I am working in a small travel company. The company has bankrupted and i lost my main job, which i supporsed to use to pay my loan tuition.   The bank asked me to pay the entire loan immediately, the deadline is 3 months later. I asked the school for a refund of the tuition fee and gave up my studies, but because I had already gone through half of the program, only half of the tuition was refunded. If I couldn't repay the loan, they would sue me and I would definitely go to jail. This will end my life, because the people who had committed crimes against me and I ran away from them, are the people in the police industry.  I have been doing a couple side jobs to pay monthly rent and expenses (I have worked ~14 hours per day all these years). Because the epidemic is still developing, my country's economy has plummeted, it's hard to find a new full-time job right now (Im still trying). Sometimes I think life is so unfair to me, but I know I'm still one of the luckiest people in the world when I'm still able to breathe everyday.  I knew that the epidemic would not end soon and the economy in my country would not recover soon, I tried to manage everything before finding the last way to seek support here. I am alone, without friend or relatives, without any support other than myself. I'm always proud of myself being my own superhero. But sometimes, specifically right now, the hero is already exhausted.  It is difficult for me to disclose all my personal information, because as I said above, my identity now is completely different from I was six years ago, and in a communist country, the publication of what I've been through can ruin my life. If you are interested, I will tell my story to you personally, please message me privately.   I know you will find it hard to believe my story, so please consider I'm begging you for a job, I know drawing and graphic design, please let me work for you, so you dont have to wonder if your kindness is being used. I would be happy to express my appreciation for your support by drawing you a portrait of yourself, or doing some graphic design like a banners or poster, anything you request - this is my firm commitment.  P/s : When I had money I used to donate monthly to a non-profit organization for the homeless and the blind, as a way of thanking life for giving me a second chance to live. When I posted this fundraiser, gofundme gave me a number of tasks to share with relatives, friends, social networking sites ... I suddenly felt hilarious for my destiny. I have no close ones in real life, and no friend on internet (I don't use any social networks - due to my special circumstances). If you come across my post, please do me a favour by sharing it on social media, because I don't have a chance to do that, and maybe very quickly this fundraiser will be forgotten. I still expect a miracle to happen here, even though I know the chances of it happening are very low...",

This fundraiser will be ran collectively by myself, Terry‚Äôs son Jeremy, and his wife Lee Ann. Jeremy and I have a soon to be four year old son Ryder, who is Terry‚Äôs grandson. ¬†  Why We‚Äôre Asking For Help  Recently Terry was diagnosed with Stage 3 Esophageal Cancer.  This is a fundraiser to assist with medical costs for the necessary tests, treatments, medications, and anything else related to this difficult process, as he currently does not have health insurance. I believe asking for help can be a difficult thing to do, but in this situation it‚Äôs a necessary step in order to alleviate some of the stress associated with the astronomical costs of health care. ¬†(The goal amount is an abstract number so far, as we are unsure yet of exact costs in future).   A Little Back Story  For those who don‚Äôt know him, Terry is a loved husband, ¬†father, and grandfather. He and his wife Lee Ann are still grieving from the untimely passing of their son Trevor at 21 years old, and it has been a difficult couple years for the family and everyone surrounding us. Terry is a musician, playing guitar and singing with his band JusTed in various venues around St. Louis. That love of music seems to be passed on to his grandson, who often asks to go play drums at Paw Paw‚Äôs studio.¬†  We thank you for taking the time to read this, and thank you in advance for any help given. Times like these are not easy for anyone involved, and so any help that alleviates the stress of an already worrisome situation means more than any will know.¬†  Thank You‚ù§Ô∏è        ",

            "description": "Rome, 19/02/2020  Friends,   My name is Sophia Lilin Wu. I am a lay Chinese student of Theology, in the second year of the first cycle in Pontifical Gregorian University. As you all know, since the beginning of this new year 2020, China, especially Wuhan has suffered from the coronavirus. And because of this strong influence, this virus soon spread beyond Wuhan to other parts of China and around the world.  Seeing such suffering happening every day, my heart is broken. In order to help the Chinese people fight the coronavirus, especially to help my family who are living in Shandong province, I bought nearly 700 masks and sent them to China both to Shandong and to Beijing. A friend of mine in Beijing told me that even the doctors and nurses in the Hospital cannot find masks now, to say nothing of other people. Therefore, I tried my best to help them. As you see, without a mask, you cannot move one step regarding the high risks. Scientists found that the coronavirus even can influence people by air just in two seconds.   They urgently need to have enough masks in order to have at least the basic protection. I am the only one child in my family. From my childhood until now, both my father and mother tried their best to give me everything I need, to educate me in the best school, to encourage me to graduate from the best University in China (Peking University) as a Doctor of Philosophy, to support me to study Catholic theology in Rome even though they themselves are not Christians. However, the real and deep love is that whatever the decision I made they supported me. Love should repay love. So, I decide to give them the best medical supplies. From Jan.25th, the Chinese New Year until now Feb.19th, 2020, almost each day, I am looking for masks or sending masks. Finally, until today, there are already seven hundred masks going to China. Nonetheless, the ordinary shipping cannot go to China nowadays regarding the high risks, only DHL could help me to ship masks to China. But the cheapest and the smallest box in DHL cost 58 euro. In order to guarantee that they have masks in China, I must send many times and only for shipping in this month, almost 500 euro was spent. And because of the high needs, the price of masks rises 2 to 3 times. For example, before one masks FFP2 cost 5 euro, now you need to pay 10 euro, and masks FFP3 before 7 euro, now you should pay from 15 to 20 euro. But it can only use 8 hours. Though some friends also help me with some contributions, one month later, my bankcard finally has no money left. I remember in the evening of Feb. 17th, the first day of the second semester, the pharmacy called me they found more masks of FFP2. However, from my bankcard I can only buy 29 masks, then there is no money on this card. This money is the fund for supporting my living and studying in Rome, my mom transferred to me in last September. She always thought if there is something in urgent need, for example, when I got sick need to buy medicine, or want to go home, I can buy tickets. But now all of them turned to be masks. Indeed, before if I have urgent need, I can ask for support from parents. However, now China is at a standstill. I even do not know whether or not my father still has salary. Then I decided that this time, it is not they support me but I who support them. So, friends, please help me to continue my life and study in Rome. Just left one and half year, I will finish my first cycle of theology in Gregorian University. I have a basic scholarship which can support me bed and food, therefore, I ask for your help for this small part, in these seven months (from now to September). I need some money to do scan and photocopy, to prepare documents for applying new scholarship and for the summer tickets to go and back between Rome and Cracow. I have a dream that when finishing all of these studies, to work and live in Poland, so during the summer, I already planned to return to Poland to learn Polish. The scholarship for learning Polish, however, does not include transportation.  The belief for the beauty of human hearts push me to write this letter. As the song which was singing in the Beijing Olympic 2008 expressed: you and me, heart to heart, we are family.  Thank you with my deep heart, and I believe God will repay for your kindness.  ¬†  ¬†  ¬†  ¬†  ¬†  ¬†",

            "description": "R√≥ma, 2020.02.19  Bar√°taim!  A nevem Sophia Lilin Wu. Laikus k√≠nai teol√≥gia hallgat√≥ vagyok, a P√°pai Gergely Egyetemen az els≈ë ciklus m√°sodik √©v√©ben. Mint mindannyian tudj√°tok, a 2020-as √©v kezdete √≥ta K√≠na, k√ºl√∂n√∂sen Wuhan szenvedett a koronav√≠rus miatt. √âs ennek az er≈ëteljes influenz√°nak k√∂sz√∂nhet≈ëen a v√≠rus hamarosan Wuhanon √°t √°tterjedt K√≠na m√°s r√©szeire √©s a vil√°g minden t√°jaira is.  A szenved√©st nap mint nap l√°tva megszakad a sz√≠vem. Annak √©rdek√©ben, hogy seg√≠tsek a k√≠nai n√©pnek a koronav√≠rus elleni k√ºzdelemben, k√ºl√∂n√∂s tekintettel a Shandong tartom√°nyban √©l≈ë csal√°domnak, k√∂zel 700 maszkot v√°s√°roltam √©s K√≠n√°ba k√ºldtem (mind Shandongba, mind Pekingbe). Egy pekingi bar√°tom azt mondta nekem, hogy m√©g a k√≥rh√°z orvosai √©s √°pol√≥i sem tal√°lnak maszkokat, nem is besz√©lve az egyszer≈± emberekr≈ël. Ez√©rt minden t≈ëlem telhet≈ët megtettem hogy megpr√≥b√°ljak seg√≠teni nekik. Mint l√°tj√°tok, maszk n√©lk√ºl nem lehet tenni egy l√©p√©st sem az utc√°n a magas kock√°zat miatt. A tud√≥sok √°ll√≠tj√°k hogy a koronav√≠rus ak√°r k√©t m√°sodperc alatt is k√©pes leveg≈ën √°t megfert≈ëzni az embereket.  S√ºrg≈ësen elegend≈ë maszkkal kell rendelkezni√ºk ahhoz, hogy legal√°bb az alapvet≈ë v√©delmet biztos√≠ts√°k. √ân vagyok az egyetlen gyermek a csal√°domban. Gyerekkoromt√≥l kezdve eg√©szen mostan√°ig √©desap√°m √©s √©desany√°m minden t≈ël√ºk telhet≈ët megtettek, hogy mindent megadhassanak, a legjobb iskol√°ban neveljenek, √©s arra √∂szt√∂n√∂zzenek, hogy filoz√≥fiai doktork√©nt v√©gezzem k√≠nai legjobb egyetem√©t (pekingi egyetem), hogy t√°mogassanak a katolikus teol√≥gia tanul√°s√°ra R√≥m√°ban, b√°r ≈ëk maguk nem kereszt√©nyek. A val√≥di √©s m√©ly szeretet√ºk abban √°ll, hogy b√°rmi is volt a d√∂nt√©sem, t√°mogattak engem. A szeretetnek vissza kell fizetnie a szeretetet. Sz√≥val √∫gy d√∂nt√∂ttem, hogy a legjobb orvosi ell√°t√°st adom nekik. Janu√°r 25-t≈ël, a k√≠nai √∫j√©vt≈ël mostan√°ig, 2020. febru√°r 19-ig, szinte minden nap maszkot keresek vagy maszkot k√ºld√∂k. Ily m√≥don m√°r siker√ºlt h√©tsz√°z maszkot K√≠n√°ba k√ºldenem. Mindazon√°ltal a szok√°sos sz√°ll√≠t√°s nem mehet K√≠n√°ba a magas kock√°zatok miatt, csak a DHL tudott seg√≠teni a maszkok K√≠n√°ba sz√°ll√≠t√°s√°ban. De a DHL legolcs√≥bb √©s legkisebb doboza 58 eur√≥ba ker√ºlt. Az√©rt hogy legyen el√©g maszk K√≠n√°ban, t√∂bb k√ºldem√©nyt kellett k√ºldenem, √©s csak ebben a h√≥napban a sz√°ll√≠t√°sra k√∂zel 500 eur√≥t k√∂lt√∂ttem el. A nagy ig√©nyek miatt a maszkok √°ra is 2-3-szoros√°ra emelkedett. P√©ld√°ul, kor√°bban egy FFP2 maszk 5 eur√≥ba ker√ºlt, most 10 eur√≥t kell fizetni √©rte. Az FFP3 maszk√©rt kor√°bban 7 eur√≥t kellett fizetni, most 15-20 eur√≥ba ker√ºl. De ez csak 8 √≥r√°n kereszt√ºl haszn√°lhat√≥. B√°r n√©h√°ny bar√°tom is hozz√°j√°rult bizonyos kiad√°saimhoz, egy h√≥nap eltelt√©vel, a bankk√°rty√°mr√≥l v√©g√ºl minden p√©nz elfogyott. Eml√©kszem, hogy febru√°r 17-√©n este, a m√°sodik f√©l√©v els≈ë napj√°n a gy√≥gyszert√°r felh√≠vott, hogy tal√°ltak t√∂bb maszkot az FFP2-b≈ël. A bankk√°rty√°mon l√©v≈ë p√©nzb≈ël azonban csak 29 maszkot v√°s√°rolhatok. Ez a p√©nz az alap a r√≥mai √©letem √©s tanul√°som t√°mogat√°s√°ra, √©desany√°m tavaly szeptemberben utalta √°t nekem. Mindig azt gondolta, hogy ha lenne valami s√ºrg≈ës sz√ºks√©g, p√©ld√°ul ha gy√≥gyszert kellene v√°s√°rolnom, vagy haza kellene mennem, ebb≈ël tudn√©k magamnak jegyet venni. De most az eg√©sz p√©nzt maszkokra ford√≠tottam. Val√≥ban, kor√°bban s√ºrg≈ës sz√ºks√©g eset√©n, t√°mogat√°st k√©rhettem volna a sz√ºl≈ëkt≈ël. Most azonban K√≠na le van blokkolva. M√©g azt sem tudom, hogy √©desap√°mnak van-e tov√°bbra is fizet√©se? Azt√°n √∫gy d√∂nt√∂ttem, hogy ez√∫ttal nem ≈ëk t√°mogatnak engem, hanem √©n t√°mogatom ≈ëket. Teh√°t, bar√°taim, k√©rlek benneteket, seg√≠tsetek nekem az √©letem folytat√°s√°ban √©s a r√≥mai tanulm√°nyaimban! M√°r csak f√©l √©v maradt hogy befejezzem az els≈ë ciklust a Gregoriana egyetemen. Van egy alap √∂szt√∂nd√≠jam, amely megadja nekem a meg√©lhet√©st. De az ezen t√∫lmen≈ë kiad√°saimhoz a seg√≠ts√©geteket szeretn√©m k√©rni az elk√∂vetkez≈ë h√©t h√≥napban (mostant√≥l szeptemberig). Sz√ºks√©gem van n√©mi p√©nzre a scannel√©shez √©s a f√©nym√°sol√°shoz az egyetemen, tov√°bb√° az √∫j √∂szt√∂nd√≠j ig√©nybev√©tel√©hez sz√ºks√©ges dokumentumok el≈ëk√©sz√≠t√©s√©hez, valamint a ny√°ri utik√∂lts√©gre R√≥ma √©s Krakk√≥ k√∂z√∂tt. Van egy √°lmom, hogy a tanulm√°nyaim befejezt√©vel Lengyelorsz√°gban dolgozhatok √©s √©lhetek, teh√°t a ny√°r folyam√°n m√°r terveztem visszat√©rni Lengyelorsz√°gba lengyel nyelvet tanulni. A lengyel nyelv tanul√°s√°nak √∂szt√∂nd√≠ja azonban nem tartalmazza az √∫tik√∂lts√©get.  Az emberi sz√≠v sz√©ps√©g√©be vetett hit √∂szt√∂nz√∂tt arra, hogy meg√≠rjam ezt a levelet. Ahogy a 2008-as pekingi olimpia √©nek√©ben is √°ll: ‚Äúte √©s √©n, sz√≠vb≈ël sz√≠vbe, egy csal√°d vagyunk‚Äù.  Sz√≠vb≈ël k√∂sz√∂n√∂m, √©s hiszem, hogy Isten megfizeti a kedvess√©geteket!",

            "description": " THE TIME TO ACT IS NOW! YOU HOLD THE KEY TO PUTTING THE BRAKES ON THE CORONAVIRUS EPIDEMIC The Coronavirus is an epidemic that currently defies containment! Health authorities have been struggling to contain its spread ever since its discovery. Yet, the virus has now been declared a ‚ÄòPublic Health Emergency of International Concern‚Äô by the World Health Organization.  ¬†75,775 cases have been confirmed as of 20 February 2019, affecting every Chinese province and more than two dozen additional countries. 11,795 of these cases are serious and 2,130 individuals have died. There are travel restrictions in place, and signs of economic instability loom on the horizon. While scientists work frantically to develop a vaccine, the numbers of those afflicted continue to rise. Handwashing and distributing n95 masks seem to be the only way to deter its spread. But it‚Äôs not a perfect solution, and keeping up with the demand for masks is daunting. My name is (mark v). I have launched this campaign to raise funds to quickly produce over one million n95 masks to distribute to children and hospitals before the current supply runs out. I have a production goal of 200,000 masks daily and am confident that I can reach this goal with your help! I am currently seeking $250,000 to order a production machine and two containers of materials to initiate production before it‚Äôs too late! ¬†Reaching this goal will also entail building a factory capable of mass production. I have identified Vietnam as the most logical place to launch this project because of its proximity to China and its robust labor force. ¬†My plan is to then quickly apply new technology, such as incorporating copper into the masks‚Äô construction and/or a sodium chloride salt coating to destroy the pathogens. These two improvements will make n95 masks 100% effective. As an entrepreneur, my visionary thinking and problem-solving skills have prepared me for success. I will personally fly to Vietnam to hire the right people and oversee the factory‚Äôs operations 24/7. But the generosity of donors is the real key to making my project a reality.

            "description": "Rom, 19/02/2020  Liebe Freunde,  ¬†  ich hei√üe Sophia Lilin Wu. Ich bin eine chinesische Laiin und Theologie-Studentin im zweiten Jahr vom ersten Studienzyklus an der P√§pstliche Gregoriana Universit√§t. Wie Sie wissen, erleidet China, besonders Wuhan, das Coronavirus seit Anfang des neuen Jahres 2020. Da dieses Virus so resistent ist, hat es sich auch bald ausgebreitet in anderen Teilen Chinas und der Welt.  Mein Herz bricht wenn ich so viel t√§gliches Leid anschauen muss. Um das chinesische Volk helfen zu k√∂nnen das Coronavirus zu bek√§mpfen und insbesondere um meine Verwandten zu helfen, die in der Shandong-Provinz wohnen, habe ich fast 700 Mundmasken gekauft und nach China gesandt (Shandong und Beijing). Einer meiner Freunde in Beijing sagte mir dass sogar die √Ñrzte und Krankenschwestern in den Spit√§lern heutzutage keine Masken finden k√∂nnen, um √ºber andere Leute gar nicht zu reden. Darum habe ich versucht Ihnen zu helfen. Ohne Maske kann man ja nirgendswo hingehen wegen den gro√üen Gesundheitsrisiken. Untersucher haben jetzt herausgefunden dass es sogar √ºber die Luft √ºbertragbar ist in nur zwei Sekunden.   Sie brauchen dringend gen√ºgend Masken um ein Grundschutz zu haben. Ich bin einziges Kind. Von meiner j√ºngsten Kindheit ab, haben meiner Vater und meine Mutter ihr Bestes gegeben um mir mit den besten Sorgen zu umgeben, in der besten Schule zu erziehen, mich zu ermutigen an der beste Universit√§t Chinas zu promovieren als Doktor in Philosophie, meine Studien der katholischen Theologie in Rom zu unterst√ºtzen ‚Äì obwohl sie selber gar nicht christlich sind. Ihre echte und tiefe Liebe ist was ihr dazu gebracht mich in all meine Entscheidungen zu unterst√ºtzen. Liebe braucht Gegenliebe. Deswegen entschied ich mich dazu ihnen die beste √§rztliche Hilfsmittel zu geben. Vom 25. Januar, das chinesische Neujahr, bis heute habe ich fast jeden Tag ausgeschaut nach Masken um nach China zu schicken. Bis heute sind schon 700 Masken nach China gegangen. Schwierig ist aber dass die normale Transportwege nach China nicht mehr funktionieren, nur DHL konnte mir helfen diese Masken zu transportieren. Aber das billigste und kleinste DHL-Paket kostet schon 58 Euro. Um eine fixe Pr√§senz von Masken in China zu garantieren, musste ich oft Pakete schicken ‚Äì in dieser Monat habe ich fast 500 Euro f√ºr Transport zahlen m√ºssen. Und wegen der gro√üe Nachfrage, steigern sich die Preise der Masken. Zum Beispiel: eine FFP2-Maske kostete 5 Euro, heute aber schon 10 Euro. Eine FFP3-Maske kostete vorher 7 Euro, jetzt 15 bis 20 Euro. Sie k√∂nnen aber nur 8 Stunden verwendet werden. Obwohl manche Freunde mir geholfen haben, habe ich nach eine Monat kein Geld mehr auf mein Bankkonto. I erinnere mich am Abend des 17. Februar, den ersten Tag des zweiten Semester, wenn die Apotheke mir anrief mit der Mitteilung dass sie mehr FFP2-Masken gefunden h√§tten. Mit mein Geld konnte ich aber nur noch 29 Masken kaufen. Dieses Geld war mir in September von meiner Mutter gegeben f√ºr mein Lebensunterhalt und Studium in Rom. Se meinte immer dass ich etwas brauche f√ºr Notf√§lle, z.B. um Medizinen zu kaufen wenn ich krank w√§re oder ein Ticket nach Hause kaufen zu k√∂nnen. Jetzt hat sich aber all dieses Geld in Masken verwandelt. Fr√ºher konnte ich mich immer auf meine Eltern berufen wenn ich in Not war. Jetzt aber steht China still. Ich wei√ü gar nicht ob mein Vater noch ein Gehalt bekommt. Darum entschloss ich mich dass ich diesmal ihnen helfen musste. Liebe Freunde, hilf mir bitte um mein Leben und Studium in Rom weitersetzen zu k√∂nnen. Es fehlt nur anderthalb Jahr um meinem ersten Zyklus der Theologie zu beenden an der Gregoriana Universit√§t. Ich habe eine Studienb√∂rse die mir ein Unterkommen und Essen gibt, brauche aber etwas Geld f√ºr die n√§chste sieben Monate (bis September): f√ºr Scans, Kopien, f√ºr die Vorbereitung von Anfragen f√ºr eine neue Studienb√∂rse und um Tickets von und nach Krakau zahlen zu k√∂nnen im Sommer. Ich tr√§ume n√§mlich nach meine Studien in Polen zu leben und zu arbeiten, darum habe ich schon ein Aufenthalt in Polen geplant im Sommer, um Polnisch zu studieren. Die Studienb√∂rse f√ºr das Polnisch-Unterricht deckt aber keine Transportkosten.  Der Glauben an die Sch√∂nheit der Menschenherzen treibt mich an dieser Brief zu schreiben. Wie das Lied der Olympischen Spiele in Beijing 2008 es ausdruckte: du und ich, Herz zu Herz, wir sind Familie.  Ich danke Ihnen von ganzem Herzen und glaube dass Gott ihre G√ºte vergelten wird!  ¬†  ¬†  ¬†  ¬†  ¬†  ¬†  ¬†  ¬†",

            "description": "Rome, 19/02/2020  Chers amis,  ¬†  Je m'appelle Sophia Lilin Wu. Je suis une √©tudiante de th√©ologie chinoise, maintenant dans la deuxi√®me ann√©e du premier cycle √† l'Universit√© Pontificale Gr√©gorienne. Comme vous savez bien, la Chine, en particulier Wuhan, souffre du virus corona d√®s le d√©but de 2020. Vu qu'il est tr√®s r√©sistent, ce virus se r√©pands bien vite dans d'autres parties de la Chine et du monde.  Face √† cette d√©tresse mon c≈ìur se rompt. Pour aider le peuple chinois √† combattre ce virus et en particulier pour aider ma famille qui habite dans la province de Shandong, j'ai achet√© presque 700 masques et je les ai envoy√©s √† Shandong et √† P√©kin. Un ami √† P√©kin m'a racont√© qu'entretemps m√™me les m√©decins et les infirmi√®res dans les h√¥pitaux ne trouvent plus de masques, pour ne pas parler des autres. C'est la raison pour laquelle je cherche de faire mon mieux pour leur donner un coup de main. En effet, on ne peut pas bouger sans masque √† cause des grandes risques de contamination. Les chercheurs ont entretemps retrouv√© que le virus se r√©pande m√™me dans l'air dans seulement deux secondes.  Tout de suite ils ont besoin d'assez de masques pour garantir une protection minimale. Je suis enfant unique. De ma premi√®re enfance jusqu'√† maintenant mon p√®re et ma m√®re ont fait leur mieux pour me donner tout dont j'avais besoin: une √©ducation dans la meilleure √©cole, l'encouragement √† obtenir un doctorat en philosophie √† la meilleure universit√© de Chine (l'Universit√© de P√©kin), le soutien √† √©tudier la th√©ologie catholique √† Rome (bien qu'ils ne sont pas chr√©tiens).C'est leur amour r√©el et fort qui les a pouss√©s √† me soutenir toujours. Amour redemande amour. Ainsi je me suis d√©cid√© de leur donner les meilleures aides m√©dicales. Du 25 janvier, la nouvelle ann√©e chinoise, jusqu‚Äôaujourd'hui j'ai cherch√© des masques √† envoyer en Chine. Entretemps 7000 masques sont en train d'y partir. Mais ‚Ä¶ les cargos normaux ne partent plus pour la Chine, seulement DHL pourrait m'aider. Leur paquet le plus petit et le plus √©conomique coute n√©anmoins 58 euros. Pour garantir un r√©serve de masques en Chine je dois leur envoyer tr√®s souvent des paquets. Ce mois-ci ca m‚Äôa cout√© presque 500 euros. A cause du besoin le prix des masques augmente beaucoup. Auparavant un masque ne FFP2 co√ªtait que 5 euros, maintenant on a besoin de 10 euros. Un masque FFP3 co√ªtait 7 euros, maintenant 15 √† 20 euros. Et √ßa ne peut √™tre utilis√© que durant 8 heures. Bien que certains amis ont contribu√©, apr√®s un mois je n'ai plus d'argent sur mon compte bancaire. Je me souviens le soir du 17 f√©vrier quand la pharmacie m'appelait parce qu'ils avaient trouv√© d'autres masques FFP2. Mais avec ma carte bancaire je ne pouvais plus acheter que 29 masques. Cet argent, qui n'y est plus, m'avait √©t√© donn√© par ma m√®re en septembre pour financier ma vie et mes √©tudes √† Rome. Ma maman voulait que j'aurais toujours les moyens de m'acheter des m√©decins si je tomberais malade ou de me procurer un ticket pour tourner chez moi. Maintenant tout cet argent-l√† s'est transform√© en masques. Auparavant je pourrais toujours me tourner vers mes parents si j'√©tais dans le besoin. Maintenant la Chine s'est bloqu√©e. Je ne sais m√™me pas si mon p√®re re√ßoit encore un salaire. Ainsi je me suis d√©cid√© de les aider moi-m√™me, cette fois-ci. Donc, chers amis, je vous demande de m'aider √† continuer ma vie et mes √©tudes √† Rome. Ainsi je pourrais finir mon premier cycle de th√©ologie √† l‚ÄôUniversit√© Gr√©gorienne. J‚Äôai une bourse d‚Äô√©tudes qui me procure aussi l‚Äôh√©bergement et de la nourriture. C‚Äôest donc seulement une petite aide que je vous demande pour ces sept mois (de maintenant jusqu‚Äô√† septembre)¬†: j‚Äôai besoin d‚Äôun petit peu d‚Äôargent pour faire des scans et photocopies, pour pr√©parer les applications pour une nouvelle bourse d‚Äô√©tudes et pour les tickets de voyage en √©t√© entre Rome et Cracovie. Je songe d‚Äôaller vivre et travailler en Pologne apr√®s mes √©tudes, donc durant l‚Äô√©t√© j‚Äôai un voyage d√©j√† programm√© en Pologne pour y √©tudier le polonais ‚Äì mais la bourse n‚Äôinclut pas le voyage.  C‚Äôest ma foi dans la beaut√© des c≈ìurs humaines qui me pousse √† √©crire cette lettre. Comme l‚Äôexprimait la chanson des Jeux Olympiques de P√©kin 2008¬†: toi et moi, c≈ìur √† c≈ìur, nous sommes famille.  Merci de tout c≈ìur ‚Äì Dieu vous r√©compensera votre bont√©.  ¬†  ¬†  ¬†  ¬†  ¬†",

It‚Äôs something I was so desperate to do not only to change my life for the better, ¬†but to make myself and my family proud. Each day I wake up thankful to be here, thankful that I went through with this dream and continue to make my dad proud.¬† Since the CoronaVirus decided to appear, not only has the world come to a stop still but also my mind and mental health as abruptly come crashing down. So much so I‚Äôve contemplating giving up this dream completely, so much so that Im sleep depriving myself, so much so that anxiety and panic attacks have become second nature. Then I think about leaving again, something I know will make me feel like an even bigger failure. During this outbreak it has left me uncertain of how I might continue to not only have a roof over my head, ¬†but cover basic needs such as food and water. The virus has stopped all schools from opening, which in turn means us teachers are left with nothing. As it stands the schools are not due to open any time soon which does mean basic living necessities will be something I no longer have access to. Food and water will no longer be a viable option, let alone having somewhere to live.¬† All I‚Äôm asking for is help, in any way shape or form. Every penny counts, and I will use whatever funds are raised to cover living expenses as well as manage to feed and water myself. Any further funds that I manage to raise will goto a charity that helps individuals in crisis situations. I don‚Äôt expect anyone to donate however if you choose to, just know that I am beyond grateful. I will forever be truly thankful ‚ô•Ô∏è",

            "description": "Hello and thank you for visiting my campaign.  My name is Felicity Stanway and since June 2018 I've had the amazing opportunity to work in the beautiful city of Guilin as both coach, consultant and technical director of Golden Saddle Equestrian Club. It has been both a challenge and a joy in helping to raise the awareness of horse welfare and best work practices whilst educating the next generation of coaches and riders in what was a fast growing equestrian industry in the economic powerhouse that is China.    The goals at Golden Saddle were to become one of the leading equestrian educators in the country with the focus being on educating the local industry about best world practices for horse welfare, riding and coach education, whilst also being a sustainable learning centre for the greater public connecting people with the wonderful healing powers of the horse.¬†     The outbreak of the COVID19 virus it has created an unplanned industry crushing scenario.¬† With the whole country in lockdown up to 70% of all businesses country wide have been forced to cease operations having what will be a national economic crisis. Ultimately this means that Golden Saddle along with many other equestrian clubs and businesses are trying to survive without any income.¬†¬† The unfortunate situation that sets a business such as Golden Saddle apart is that in such a shutdown with 48 horses needing care the club cannot simply lay off staff and close production until things blow over. The horses still need care and exercise and all the daily chores still need doing.     I've created this fund to help the man that has shared with me his vision, Mr Yu, my boss, known by his English name Kerwin.¬†¬† He had a dream at a young age to own his own horse club, and in October last year he made the very bold decision to buy out the other partner in the club in order to be able to have full control over the clubs future and entrusting the horses welfare and management to me.¬† Unfortunately due to the virus outbreak and after much consultation the tough decision was made that I was to come home amidst the fears that the virus spread and lockdown would potentially continue for an unspecified amount of time and the financial future of the club was in question.¬†     Kerwin has been the most supportive and enthusiastic boss and it has been heartbreaking coming home and leaving my team and the horses behind with the fate of their future unknown.¬† My goal of this Go Fund Me campaign is to raise enough funds to help support Kerwin over the next few months in keeping the club running whilst China recovers from this horrible unforeseen tragedy. Thankfully before the new year the club had purchased enough feed supply to keep the horses going to until at least the end of March, it's the staff costs that will be the main outgoings. With a fulltime staff of 6 coaches and 4 support staff, who are all currently in lockdown living at the¬†club, my dedicated former team are already willing to sacrifice part of their pay just to stay and keep the club going.¬† These people have not only been my work colleagues over the last 18 months they have become my family, so although I am now not able to be with them my goal is to help keep them all employed and give the club the best possible chance of recovery for the future.         Your donations will be massively appreciated and contribute not only to the Golden Saddle club but the future of horse welfare in China starting with the wonderful 48 horses that call Golden Saddle home.  There will also be plan for the future to create a website where you will be able to check in and virtually meet all of the Golden Saddle staff and horses personally and see the difference your donation has made.  So in conclusion I would like to personally thank each of you for reading my cause and donating to keep Golden Saddle alive, and hope that one day you may get a chance to visit the team at Golden Saddle and take pride in the knowledge that you helped keep an amazing dream alive.

We decided to make this gofundme project to help with the little we can and buy some masks for hospitals in #Wuhan.   \r\n \r\n\r\n  Chinese health officials reported on 2/29/2020 that there had been 2838 deaths from the outbreak and 79394 cases of the coronavirus.  \r\n \r\n\r\n Tons of medical workers are still struggling on the front line , the day and night¬†battling with the virus and trying to save as many people as possible, but they need to protect themselves first to do so!! We achieved our first goal and helped the first hospital but we are not going to stop and we want to continue helping with the help of our friends around the world.     With the money we already raised, we sent an order for masks, gloves and suits by the doctors of a hospital that arrived this 02/23/2020       \r\n \r\n\r\n        \r\n \r\n\r\n   From February 29 to March 1, the Mercadito ON in Arica, Chile, together with volunteers from China, invite you to be part of donations to help Jingxia District Red Cross Hospital to face the CoVid19 virus. Address: Anzuelo y Carbones Restaurant, Camino Azapan n 4040, Arica, Chile  \r\n \r\n\r\n  \r\n \r\n\r\n  Wuhan and China gave us a lot, a home, a job, a place to study, this is the moment to give back!! If you want to contribute for this cause, share the link and thank you a thousand times!    Let‚Äôs fight together! Wuhan jiayou Ê≠¶Ê±âÂä†Ê≤πÔºÅ      \r\n \r\n\r\n    ¬°Hola a todos!

Decidimos hacer este proyecto de gofundme para ayudar con lo poco que podemos y comprar ¬†materiales m√©dicos para hospitales en #Wuhan.   Funcionarios de salud chinos informaron el 29/02/2020 que hubo 2838 muertes por el brote y 79394 casos de coronavirus.   Muchos doctores y enfermeros todav√≠a est√°n en la l√≠nea del frente, el d√≠a y la noche luchando contra el virus y tratando de salvar a la mayor cantidad de personas posible, ¬°pero necesitan protegerse primero para hacerlo! Logramos nuestro primer objetivo y ayudamos al primer hospital pero no nos vamos a parar y queremos seguir ayudando con la ayuda de nuestros amigos en todo el mundo.   Con el dinero que ya recaudamos, enviamos un pedido de mascarillas, guantes y trajes por los doctores de un hospital que llegaron este 23/02/2020      \r\n \r\n\r\n       Desde el 29 de Febrero hasta el 1 de Marzo el Mercadito ON de Arica, Chile juntos con los voluntarios de China os invitan a ser parte de las donaciones en ayuda de Jingxia District Red Cross Hospital para enfrentar al virus CoVid19.

He was the whistleblower¬† doctor who tried to¬† worn others about the a new Coronavirus were showing up in patients eyes.  Dr. Wenliang was an ophthalmologist who first identified the Coronavirus as patients with severe infection in one or both eyes were presenting. He saw the relationship between these unusual eye infections and this developing into pneumonia.\r\n\r\n ¬†\r\n \r\n\r\n The world was saddened by his death after constructing the Coronavirus now known as Covid19.¬†     People are Infecting Themselves ¬†  The virus is spread through hand to face or hand to eye contact. People are touching infected¬† surfaces¬† such as¬† door knobs ,¬† elevator buttons¬† grocery carts and many other hard surfaces. It has being proven that the coronavirus can live on hard surfaces as long as 9 days.¬†  If someone is infected with the Coronavirus and coughs into their hands or is simplimatic the transmission occurs when you touch that same door handle then rub your eyes. This is how coronavirus is spread.      Doctors Urge Patients to Wash¬† ¬†Hands Frequently¬†   Doctors are urging the public to becone more vigilant and aware of the surfaces they are touching. Any surface especially hard surfaces which are touched frequently may be contaminated with the Coronavirus. In a busy setting such as a school or office building, hundreds of people are touching the same door handles railings and other hard surfaces then touching their face and eyes.   The Average Person Touches Their Face 2,000 Tines a Day   Several studies have shown that on average we touch our faces between 1,200 and 2,000 times each day. We must become much more aware our habit of touching door handles and other common areas then touching our faces or rubbing our eyes. Dr. Li Wenliang said \"If we can't break the habit of touching our faces we will never beat Coronavirus\".    Wearing Googles Prevent Hand Eye Contact ¬†  ¬† Wearing goggles is one simple measure we can take two dramatically decrease the speed in which this virus is spreading. The goggles will also remind us not to touch other areas of the face.   3D Printed Goggles ¬†      People who are blind generally touch more surfaces then¬† the average sighted¬†person. This dramatically increases the chances they will become infected.   You might remember me mentioning my interest with 3D printing. Right now I have all of my available printers replicating goggles of all sizes. I can currently¬† print 40 sets of goggles¬† each day. I desperately need more printers to meet the demand. I am also emailing the files to anybody with a 3D printer who wish to produce goggles for their friends and families.¬†   ¬†I am handing the googles for free to anybody who is in need. I am asking others with 3D printers to do the same.   I have established a GoFundMe account to help cover the cost of filament and other expenses expenses associated with¬† making and distributing the goggles.     gf.me/u/xkzvw9  Below is a short 3 minute video warning about hand eye contact.    https://youtu.be/DfGyYrtTheI     Here is an in-depth 21 minute video that discusses the issue in greater detail.    https://youtu.be/DPkLApDRJME   \r\n ",

            "description": "\r\n Dear Friends,\r\n \r\n\r\n  The Coronavirus (COVID19)  continues to spread throughout the world. Controlling the spread requires the mobilization of our combined efforts to fight the threat of the pandemic. A glaring problem is that there is a possible shortage of medical supplies including N95 respirator masks. The biggest producer (China) is the epicenter of the virus and might not have enough for themselves much less for the rest of the world. This means that if the virus spreads to more countries, there will be a global shortage of N95 masks. Without proper protection, individuals will be more likely to contract the virus spread it to even more people.\r\n \r\n\r\n   Article on demand for 270 million face masks ¬† \r\n \r\n\r\n One possible solution is to create improvised respirator masks. These masks would have to be relatively cheap to make from household materials. One possible design is an improvised gas mask with Cut 2-Liter soda bottle, duct tape, rubber bands, cloth, and crushed charcoal. Such a design will help prevent contracting the virus not only from airborne contaminants but also preventing the user from touching their face which is also an entry point of the virus through their eyes, nose, mouth. This simple design could be made by anyone willing any improvements would be most welcome.\r\n \r\n\r\n My proposal would be to use modern technology and methods to mobilize efforts for distributed production of improvised respirator masks. Using shared Google Sheets and Google Forms, orders can be grouped by city and zip code.¬† Facebook marketplace could also be a place to advertise. \"Manufacturers\" would buy materials and construct the masks. Customers would fill Google forms and be matched with local manufactures who would then, like Uber/Postmates, deliver the masks. To mitigate legal/fees, transactions would be made by cash(after being disinfected)/venmo/paypal upon delivery accounting for material/labor costs. Hopefully, healthy competition and innovation will mitigate price gouging that is inherent in emergency scenarios.\r\n \r\n\r\n The purpose of this fundraiser is to incentivise action and create infrastructure around the project in order to scale properly and hopefully globally. Money donated will also be given to manufacturers to create masks for local hospitals in areas affected. Hopefully, together we can ensure action to fight this impending threat and provide a glimmer of hope to those affected.\r\n \r\n\r\n ¬†\r\n \r\n\r\n  Thank you for your support. \r\n ",

            "description": "The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has infected 71,334 people worldwide. 1,775 people are now known to have died from the virus. Six health workers have died and 1,716 have been infected since the outbreak. In Wuhan, where the virus was first detected, 242 people died on the 13th February alone.    As a group of academics at  Cardiff University , we are in solidarity with our fellow collaborators in¬† Hubei Cancer Hospital in Wuhan  who are working against the clock in fighting the coronavirus and saving lives. We particularly wish to support our Chinese colleagues by funding protective equipment for frontline medical staff due to their critical shortage of medical resources. These individuals are working tirelessly to protect us, so it is vital that we protect them.     Before the outbreak, Hubei Cancer Hospital was supporting us on various projects including early cancer diagnostics using circulating biomarkers and evaluation of cancer immunotherapy effectiveness. We had two PhD students working in Wuhan since November 2019 on these collaborative projects.    In view of the increasing number of coronavirus infected patients in Wuhan after the initial outbreak, Hubei Cancer Hospital started to provide healthcare service to severely infected cases and reported their critical shortage of protective equipment.    All the donations will go solely to purchase NIOSH-certified N95 respirators and other protective equipment for medical staff in Hubei Cancer Hospital.¬† We hope more patients can receive effective treatment when adequate protective equipment is in place for medical staff. The control of the coronavirus in Wuhan is important to stop further transmission to the other countries.       The fundraising team of academics in Cardiff University aim to acquire the medical equipment using the fund and send it to Hubei Cancer Hospital by March 2020.¬† At the end of the fundraising, we will circulate a report of the use of the fund to all contributors.¬†  We are grateful for your support.

            "description": "  What we can do to help    The Greater China Club at the Wharton School (GCC) is organizing a fundraiser to help those in need in Wuhan to access critically important medical supplies, including facial masks, protective gloves, suits and other protective garments.   We are fortunate to have received support and to be closely working with Wharton alumni in China, including the founder of 1 Drugstore (111.com.cn, NASDAQ:YI) which is one the largest direct online pharmacy networks in China.   Our current plan is to procure medical supplies through our network in China (and potentially internationally) and to directly deliver to the designated treatment hospitals in Wuhan where the most urgent needs are.  GCC commits to providing 100% transparency to the entire process, including (1) providing prompt updates to donors on final destination of funds, (2) providing a donor-by-donor list of donations at the end of the fundraising process, and (3) engage in ongoing Q A and updates on progress of fundraise and supply procurement process, within reason.   Given we are a student organization and have no official bank account, we will be withdrawing money into the personal bank account of Eileen Gao, one of the GCC board members. The funds will be converted from USD to RMB and sent to our supplier and logistics partner 1 Drugstore's corporate account via international wire transfer. We will provide update on proof of receipt and transfer of funds when we have the details.   * Kind reminder: the platform may prompt you to enter a tip which is not related to our donation campaign. Please select \"Other\" if you do not wish to tip the platform in addition to your donation.    Current facts    The number of lab-confirmed cases stands at 14,000 in 23 countries as of February 2. There have been over 300 deaths, all but one in China.    To help dispel some prevailing myths around the coronavirus:    Myths: Corona is the most dangerous virus that exists Facts: The common flu kills 60 times more people annual than Corona ¬† Myths: I will die if I am diagnosed with the coronavirus Facts: An estimated 2% of cases have reported deaths and most of these deaths were associated with weaker immune systems (e.g. old age) ¬† Myths: I need to buy a hazmat suit and a N95 mask to stay protected Facts: Washing hands and sneezing into elbows are best practices to protect yourself ¬† Myths: We all need to stay away from anyone from China Facts: Coronavirus has an incubation period of around 2-14 days. Therefore if a person of Chinese descent has been living outside of China for the last 14 days or more, he/she is at no higher risk of transmitting the virus than anyone else in the broader community. ¬† As the virus has spread in China, and especially in Wuhan, hospitals reportedly have been inundated with suspected cases, and have rapidly run out of critical medical supplies, most importantly protective facial masks and suits. Below are recent official statements released by some of the hardest hit hospitals in Wuhan, appealing directly to the public for donation of medical goods.  At the same time, many governments around the world have imposed strict travel restrictions to and from China, and some have placed export restrictions on critically needed medical supplies by the abovementioned hospitals in Wuhan.  Whilst we appreciate and acknowledge the need for the efforts made by national governments to protect their own citizens, we believe times like this are when true compassion and humanitarianism need to shine through the dark clouds.    Thank you. ",

Daegu's corona virus epidemic news tells that three main emergency rooms at three hospitals have been closed/reopened due to serving patients in the last three weeks. I've heard that many public health doctors, who are medical corps non-combat physicians, are obligated to serve for treatment at Daegu, in South Korea, but they had not been provided any hotel expenses.

It's not fair and we can't keep spreading this highly infectious disease to our loved ones. It must be stopped and I hope and pray that this will help and motivate everyone to come together and fight together for a common cause, HUMAN LIFE. \r\n\r\nI am raising money for the person or people that FIND THE CURE. We should reward the person who does this incredible and miraculous job. I believe we can all fight together to find the cure and let the person or people have this money for their efforts.

This isn‚Äôt the same disease that humans can catch and is not contagious to humans. Sometimes this virus mutates and becomes known as fips. There are different types of fips but in Autumn‚Äôs case it has mutated into wet fips. The disease causes fluid build up in their organs and eventually leads to death. However there is a drug called mutian that is known to cure the disease but it is not yet available at vets throughout the world. Kittens must take the medicine for 84 days for full treatment and in most studies the majority of cats have been cured from this horrible disease. We are asking for donations to help us afford the cost of the medicine. Currently it is costing 25 dollars a day but as Autumn‚Äôs weight increases so will the dosage so it will cost more per day. We are on day 18 and have seen how well the medicine has worked for our Autumn and we really want to be able to treat her the full 84 days and give her a full life. Please donate if you can if not please just share this post so we hopefully raise enough to be able to purchase all 84 days of medication. Thank You!",

This is not limited to just China/Asia and effects are starting to show around the Globe; socially, culturally, and economically.¬†  OVER 70,000 individuals have contracted the virus, and while the bulk of cases are in China, cases are spreading all over the Globe.  -Many cities in China are in \"lockdown\" mode with many residents afraid to even go outside (even to shop for daily goods). Posts floating around the internet show Beijing and Shanghai looking like a ghost town. Over 50 Million residents in Wuhan City and Hubei Province are in lockdown. -Chinese New Year Holiday (also known as Spring Festival) which is traditionally a time of celebration and visiting friends/family has been detrimentally affected. Many restaurants, stores, malls, amusement parks (Both of Asia's Disneyland's), shopping malls, etc have been voluntarily closed down until further notice to help reduce the spread of coronavirus. The CNY has officially been extended to keep part of the workforce from going back to work. Schools have been out and will be off indefinitely until the situation improves. -Multiple Global airlines have reduced or outright cancelled their China routes to help combat the spread of coronavirus, some as far as May 2020 (Delta, United, American Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Air India, etc). Chinese travel agencies were given a mandate by the government to cease travel bookings/operations until further notice with hefty fines if they continue business -Multiple counties have restricted access from travelers traveling from China.    HOW TO HELP:  Step 1: Donate here, any amount will be a GREAT help in this time of need.  Step 2: We will collect the money raised to purchase N-95 masks, surgical masks, protective goggles, gloves, gowns, and other in-demand medical supplies. -Supplies will be purchased both locally in USA and within China to be shipped directly to hospitals in need. -Funds will be disbursed to local Organizations/Associations within Wuhan and Greater Hebei Province (including Social Welfare Groups, Medical Assistance Groups, etc)  Step 3: We will ship the supplies directly to Wuhan, China and/or surrounding areas! As well as work only with trusted and reputable organizations/associations. (FYI that Red Cross China unfortunately is NOT the most reputable and has been scandal ridden in recent years. They have a huge inventory of facemarks that they refuse to distribute, sitting in warehouses).  Step 4: We will provide photo proof/receipts as funds are used or disbursed.¬† Dropbox link with photos/documentation:¬† https://www.dropbox.com/sh/jagcamh39kxt48y/AACdwoPNSU4K1qQqjrtHCIa7a?dl=0    VOLUNTEERS NEEDED: ¬† -help spread this GoFundMe campaign -source local avenues to purchase listed medical supplies at wholesale price, as well as locate cheaper options for freight shipping goods direct to affected areas in China -identify organizations/associations within China that can best disburse donated funds to assistance most needed in China -contact  spencer@thehoogroup.com ¬†or  robertmiller@robertmiller.com ¬†to inquire and be added to our volunteer team.

            "description": "The decade of the 2020s has finally arrived. In the first month of this year, however, a sudden outbreak of the  novel Coronavirus  turned the entire world into a mess and put everyone on alert.  This novel Coronavirus is a contagious virus originated from Wuhan, China that can cause symptoms such as fever, cough, breathing difficulties, pneumonia, severe respiratory syndromes, and even death.  It expanded rapidly after it was developed through  different ways of transmission including animals to humans and humans to humans,  just like how common cold is spread. ¬†Several countries around the globe including  China, United States, Japan, Australia, France, Germany, Canada, Singapore, Malaysia, Korea, and Finland  were already found to be infected with this lethal virus.¬†  According to the Chinese government officials, t his novel Coronavirus first appeared in a seafood market on December 12, 2019. Within a short month, the number of people who are confirmed to be infected with this coronavirus had already become 14,628 along with 305 deaths.  The number has continued to climb higher and on January 30, 2020, the  W.H.O (World Health Organization) declared the outbreak of this novel Coronavirus to be a global health emergency.  Starting from February 1, 2020, t ravel to China was restricted  and this would lead to  huge economic downfalls   in every single country, especially China.¬†    Currently,  tons of doctors and medical workers were fighting against the Coronavirus at the front line, and many of them had sacrificed their lives . With a tremendous amount of infected patients,  China and many countries were facing medical shortages.  Most of the hospitals in China  desperately need supplies including masks, goggles, and protective suits .  Without these types of equipment, the medical workers can be easily exposed to the Coronavirus and this can make the situation worse.    So, we need your help! We appreciate everyone that is willing to participate in this fundraiser and  all of the generous contributions from you will be used to purchase protective medical equipment including protective suits, N95 masks, and medical goggles.  They could also be sent to China and  help scientists in research for the cure to this lethal virus.  All of these were in  urgent need for those medical workers in the front line.  We will  ensure all funds that we received will be used to purchase these types of equipment ¬†and we will update the processes.¬†   Let‚Äôs all fight against the Coronavirus together and pray for Wuhan!",

If you know me then you know my deep bond with Bella and how she's led me to the path that I am on today, advocating for animal's in Chicago. You may also know that the last several years Bella's dental disease has worsened due to genetics, causing her to lose majority of her teeth. I've been lucky enough to be in a position where I can provide Bella with the medical care she needs, but that's not the case for several dogs in Chicago. While working at Chicago Animal Control, a common issue I see with dogs is severe dental disease that has gone untreated, causing unnecessary pain and lowering the dogs quailty of life. Dental disease is easy to overlook because you can't see it at first glance and that's why One Tail at a Time wants to purchase this equipment and make it part of a standard screening for all dogs in their rescue.  One Tail at a Time is opening a medical facility that will provide medical care (INCLUDING DENTAL!!!) to dogs they take into their rescue¬†but not only that, they will be providing medical and dental care for Chicagoland Rescue and Support Program (CRISP), CRISP is a organization that assists low income families provide medical care for their family dogs.  Bella and I know the importance of dental care and how it can drastically impact your pets quality of life, so we want to be able to sponsor this piece of equipment and make sure every dog is able to live a comfortable life without oral pain. All funds raised will be directly donated to One Tail at a Time to purchase this very needed dental equipment.¬†  More information about One Tail At A Time: One Tail at a Time (‚ÄúOTAT‚Äù) is a no-kill, 501(c)3 all-breed dog rescue committed to lowering euthanasia rates in the greater Chicagoland area. OTAT achieves this through the rescue and adoption of dogs in need, comprehensive support of adopters, and community outreach including humane education programs and assistance for disadvantaged and low-income families.",

            "description": "  See our website ¬†  Coronavirus Disease 2019, commonly known as 'Coronavirus' or Covid-19, has fallen into our lives, firstly was as a problem for others:¬† In China there was a strange pneumonia epidemic, derived from bats or snakes.....one of the many news on TV!. ¬† Our lives continued to flow regularly, nothing seemed to be able to shake them so deeply, so quickly, as it actually happened within a weekend; that will remain forever etched in the memory, mine and of millions of other people.¬†  A weekend during which in northern Italy, psychosis spread freely, without any type of government filter, perhaps placed to protect businesses, from microscopic ones to multinationals. The media screamed all day long in an emergency, causing a panic reaction in the population, who rushed to stock up on food even if we were at war, deserted the streets, shops and restaurants. The same news was then reported by the media from all over the world, in fact generating what is today the real national emergency, or the inevitable and strong \"economic crisis\" that will affect most anyone who has to do with incoming tourism in Italy. DEFINITELY throughout 2020.¬† ¬† \"My name is Stefano Santaiti, and I am the General Manager of Villa Patriarca hotel, in Mirano (Ve)\".  A beautiful Venetian Villa from the 1700s; located in the lands of Tiepolo, in Mirano, a town full of historic parks and enchanting places absolutely to be seen, a few minutes from Venice. We have infected people very close but none of them are here in our municipality/town.  However, Coronavirus IMMEDIATELY brought us enormous economic hardships.¬† We had 95% of the rooms booked canceled. The prospect, UNFORTUNATELY, is to close FOREVER our VILLA..would be a tragedy not only for me but also for the families of all my staff, on average 20 people.  My pride prevents me from asking for charity, even in this difficult situation, therefore I had this idea:¬† ¬† Selling 'social' vouchers: let me explain better: anyone who wants to help us not end up in the middle of a road, will receive an 8-year voucher for the same amount, which can be spent in any of our services: pizzeria, restaurant, hotel, swimming pool.  Basically, if you want to support us, you will have a unique opportunity: You will have helped good people in difficulty due to this situation, and in return you will receive a voucher valid for 8 years (the residual duration of my rent-contract) That you can use here our beautiful property when you will want and, I will have the opportunity to shake your hand and thank you personally on behalf of all the staff, for helping us in a moment of extreme need.   Thank you.¬†  ---------------------   Guarda il nostro sito web ¬†  Il Coronavirus Desease 2019, comunemente detto ‚ÄòCoronavirus‚Äô o Covid-19, √® entrato in sordina nelle nostre vite, prima come un problema di altri: nella lontana Cina stava verificandosi una strana epidemia di polmonite, derivata dai pipistrelli o serpenti... una delle tante notizie da Tg.  Le nostre vite continuavano a scorrere regolarmente, nulla sembrava poterle scuotere cos√¨ profondamente, cos√¨ velocemente, come √® poi effettivamente successo nel giro di un weekend; che rimarr√† perennemente impresso nella memoria, mia e di altre milioni di persone.  Un weekend durante il quale nel nord Italia, la psicosi ha dilagato liberamente, senza alcun tipo di filtro governativo, posto magari a tutela delle imprese, da quelle microscopiche alle multinazionali. I media hanno urlato per tutto il giorno all‚Äôemergenza, provocando una reazione di panico nella popolazione, che si √® precipitata a far scorte alimentari nemmeno fossimo in guerra, ha disertato le strade, i negozi ed i ristoranti. Le stesse notizie sono poi state riportate dai media di tutto il mondo, generando di fatto quella che √® oggi la vera emergenza nazionale, ovvero la inevitabile e forte crisi economica che colpir√† maggiormente chiunque abbia a che fare con il turismo incoming in Italia. Sicuramente per tutto il 2020.  Mi chiamo Stefano Santaiti, e sono il gestore di Villa Patriarca hotel , a Mirano (Ve)  Una bellissima Villa Veneta del 1700; posta nelle terre del Tiepolo, a Mirano, cittadina piena di parchi storici e luoghi incantevoli assolutamente da vedere, a pochi minuti da Venezia. Abbiamo dei contagiati molto vicini. Ma nessuno qui nel comune.  Ciononostante Il Coronavirus ci ha messi in ginocchio. Abbiamo avuto la cancellazione del 95% delle camere prenotate. La prospettiva √® quella di chiudere, che sarebbe la rovina , oltre che per la mia, anche per le famiglie di tutti i nostri collaboratori, in media 20 persone.  L‚Äôorgoglio mi impedisce di chiedere la carit√†, anche in questa difficile situazione, pertanto ho avuto questa idea:  Vendere dei voucher ‚Äòsociali‚Äô: mi spiego meglio: chiunque vorr√† contribuire a non farci finire in mezzo ad una strada, ricever√† un buono valido 8 anni di pari importo, spendibile in qualsiasi nostro servizio: pizzeria, ristorante, hotel, piscina.  In pratica, se vorrete sostenerci, avrete un‚Äôoccasione unica: Avrete aiutato delle brave persone in difficolt√† a causa di questa epidemia , e riceverete in cambio un buono valido 8 anni ( la durata residua del mio contratto!) da poter usare qui da noi quando vorrete, in modo che io possa avere l‚Äôoccasione di stringervi la mano e ringraziarvi personalmente a nome di tutto lo staff, per averci aiutato in un momento di estremo bisogno.   Grazie.   Lo staff  Villa Patriarca Hotel   Mirano (VENEZIA)",

Thousands of cases have been reported in China, with a small number in countries including the United States, Thailand and Singapore.  The unprecedented move prompted people in the city of 11 million to rush to supermarkets to stock up on instant noodles, vegetables and whatever else they could put their hands on.  Residents say there has yet to be an acute shortage of food, although shelves are cleared quickly when goods arrive.  Shouguang, the country‚Äôs biggest vegetable production base, in the eastern Shandong province, has been asked to deliver 600 tons of fresh vegetables to Wuhan every day in the next 10 to 15 days, said an official in Sunjiaji, one of Shouguang‚Äôs villages.

My name is Sung Jo, and my friend's name is Katherine Ko. We were born and raised in the very mothering land of South Korea, but we both study and live in the United States. Our friends (including Frances Chow, part of this fundraising team) and my children (5 and 7 year old boys) would like to do something to help South Korea overcome the outbreak of COVID-19 ( Coronavirus).    South Korea is experiencing an exponential rise in the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, particularly in the city of Daegu, the fourth largest city in the country. South Korea just announced 334 new cases, bringing South Korea‚Äôs national tally of the virus to 1,595. (Feb. 26, 2020)  As a result of the sudden and rapid increase in the number of infections in South Korea, they are already out of surgical masks and protective gowns.    PLEASE HELP doctors, nurses, and other medical personnel working in the region and the citizens in South Korea.  Your donations will be used to purchase N95 masks, procedural masks that have 99% viral filtration, and medical/surgical gowns. Our goal is to raise enough money to get 1,000 N95 masks, 1,000 medical gowns, and 500 bottles of hand sanitizers. We will ship all of these supplies to South Korea via an express shipping company.  WE WILL REPAY YOUR KINDNESS. Thank you so much for your consideration.  Sincerely, Sung Jo, Katherine Ko, and Frances Chow  ÏïàÎÖïÌïòÏÑ∏Ïöî? Ï†ÄÌù¨Îäî ÎØ∏Íµ≠Ïóê ÏÇ¥Í≥† ÏûàÎäî ÌïúÏù∏ÏûÖÎãàÎã§.

            "description": "Due to the coronavirus breakout in China, many communities and towns are locked down to keep the virus from spreading. People from my hometown, which is a small town in far northwest of China called Qitai, are confined into their own homes like other cities for over one month. This has created great difficulties for people who have not much savings for emergencies like this. I just heard from my dad, who is currently working as a security guard for the community center, that a lot people called the center everyday because they don't have the basic necessities to get by each day, food, water, money to pay for electricity, gas and wifi, etc. wifi is needed because kids are schooled via internet at home due to the emergency. The center is trying their best to help, but it's not enough. I am currently studying in the University of Leeds in UK, so there is only so much I can do for the community I grow up in myself because I spend almost all of my money in this study. I am really grateful and sending enormous amount of love for anyone who could chip in to help my community and I am also grateful if you feel called to help but not be able to, my love and gratitude goes to you all as well. The money raised will be used to buy flour powder, rice, cooking oil, which are the most basic food people in my hometown eat everyday. Only the most basic food will be bought for them because I am thinking to help as many people as possible to survive first ¬†and if I can raise more, vegetables and meat will be bought to help them. I don't have photos or videos available at the moment due to the lockdown, but I will try to post them to help keep you updated with the process as soon as possible. Thanks again for all the help and kind hearts out there and much love to you all.xxxxxxxxxxxx...",

My Dad, however, who health is already in extremely poor condition, is right in the middle of it in China. He's 70 years old and is already on oxygen from a pulmonary embolism he had a year ago... at the moment, he's told me that most shops have closed down and the streets are empty due to the virus and most people are choosing to confine themselves to their homes so as to avoid the spread. He and his wife have both lost their jobs and struggling to make ends meet... He's a very proud man, so hearing him admit this much terrifies me. I've tried to offer my own financial support at times also, but he's far too proud to ask for help... But I'm not. Please help. I've never considered making one of these myself, and probably wouldn't if it were only for myself... but it's for my Dad. He's always worked so hard to make sure his family have always had everything they've ever wanted, despite being in a detrimental relationship that ended with him losing every cent to his name...¬† He has almost nothing to his name and I would give anything to have his last few years on this earth without the stress and worry of how to buy food for the week...¬† Thank you for absolutely anything you can afford to give...  3  ",

So far, there is no cure or vaccine for the virus, which has infected more than 80,000 people and killed more than 2,700 worldwide in the past few months. News of the drug testing came Tuesday, just as a federal health official warned that the virus will eventually start spreading in US communities. A clinical trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the antiviral drug remdesivir in adults diagnosed with coronavirus started at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, the National Institutes of Health said. The first participant is an American who was evacuated from the Diamond Princess Crew ship docked in Japan. Also on Tuesday, top officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned about the potential spreading of coronavirus in the US. \r\n \r\n",

I believe in hard work.¬†¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†I have been unemployed for the last eight years, and for the last 5 years, I have had debilitating health problems.¬† My health before then was also very bad.¬† After developing chronic insomnia in 2012, I went to the famous Dr. Don Colbert of Florida, an excellent holistic doctor who made the mistake of letting me take too much active folate, a B-vitamin to improve my concentration.¬† It gave me \"walking disease\", which forced me to walk vigorously up to 5 hours a day.¬† This could be considered a case of Akathisia, which is usually found in completely different circumtances.¬† I continued like this for two years; it destroyed my adrenal glands.¬† In November 2016, I stopped taking the active folate.¬† After two months, my body came off my \"active folate high\", revealing that my adrenal glands were destroyed.¬†  ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†Since January 2017, I have had debilitating and chronic fatigue.¬† I cannot just take iron pills or energy drinks to recover.¬† My fatigue is so bad that after typing about fifteen to thirty minutes, my wrists will become very painful from fatigue.¬† I cannot do office work.¬† I am even too tired to read most books that I find enjoyable.¬† This is not laziness or a lack of will power, but a major physical disability.¬† Sustainable and meaningful recover requires a long process of supplements and treatments arranged by the famous specialist in adrenal fatigue, Dr. Carrie Lam of Orange County, California. ¬† ¬† ¬†My health is so bad that in the very likely case that I catch the coronavirus, I am almost certain to die from it even though I am 36 years old.¬† This is because it affects mainly old people and those with pre-existing conditions - exactly like mine.¬† Therefore, I am desperate to find a way to recover from the coronavirus, as well as to help my parents pay my medical bills for Dr. Lam.¬† I could not accept money from strangers unless I had some pretty precise and well-thought out plans, which I am rapidly working to devise.¬† ¬†My current plan is to go out into a very sparsely populated rural area and either rent a small cabin/apartment for three months or to live in a tent if necessary in a state park.¬† I will consult multiple doctors to see if this is a sound idea.¬† I believe I could do this for as little as $2000-$3000.¬†¬† ¬† ¬† I would be as grateful as any man can be for somebody saving my life from certain death, which is basically what they would be doing as far as I am concerned.¬† Right now, I depend on my parents for all my needs, but my parents, even though I love and respect them, are not competent or prudent.¬† They will probably die from the virus too, but they are not taking it seriously.¬†  ¬† ¬† I would try very hard to pay my donors back and if necessary, I could get on the dole so my private donors wouldn't have to pay for my food.¬† I have never had an aptitude for planning, but I have a lot of talent and I am still idealistic enough that I am willing to undergo a lot of hardship.¬† I have a strong belief in personal responsibility, but I was too idealistic, unrealistic, and lonely in college to have the sense to study on Sundays.¬† I have some Presbyterian, Scotch-Irish blood in me and as a result, I am stubborn and self-reliant to a fault.¬†  ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†Now, though, I desperately need help to save my life.¬† I am ashamed to ask for help, but I did refuse to get on the dole or on Social Security disability for 11 years.¬† I could have been on the latter for five years with perfect justification, but I hate asking others for money.¬† I will try very hard to repay you.¬†¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†I am still very idealistic, but for twelve years I have been fully aware that I must match my idealism with a very strong work ethic and that I was mistaken in college about studying on Sunday.¬† In certain, real ways, I have never had much of a chance in life.¬† My idealism was based on the idea that America was in desperately bad shape and needed timeless wisdom to recover.¬† I still think America could benefit from the world's best source of not-so common common sense, Aristotle, if that makes sense.¬† Aristotle has been called \"the common sense philosopher\".¬† Reading him, and other old classic western books, is key to being conservative.¬† This important idea is promoted at Hillsdale College, which I deeply respect.¬† Democracy is collapsing, but that is something the founding Fathers themselves realized would happen after 1789.¬† I strongly believe that based on the thought of Plato; Aristotle; the first Duke of Wellington (the British soldier who defeated Napoleon); and Hans Hermann Hoppe.¬† While I am a patriotic American, supporting the 2nd Amendment and other bedrock American institutions, I believe America has always been decadent and doomed to collapse relatively quickly.¬†¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† I want to make the world a much more beautiful and happier place.¬† I have a lot of talent and a lot of the kind of deep, classical, western-based learning that our universities should be trying to promote instead of rampant political correctness, socialism, and other non-western ideas.¬† I even used to have great physical charisma, the remnants of which I still hope to use to get married and transmit to my children some day.¬† I would be willing to marry a woman from a poor country, if necessary.¬† Maybe my [future] children [since I have never slept with anybody or otherwise had children] can use their charisma to become famous leaders and spread a love of morality, personal responsibility, and liberty to future generations.¬† I'm not pretentious or arrogant, but very humble and embarrassed.¬†¬† ¬† ¬† Unfortunately, I would love to have enough money to head to the hills as soon as possible.¬† I would have been planning this a month ago, but my health is bad enough that I could not plan as quickly as I wanted.¬† Yes, I am goofy and very awkward, but as goofy as I am, I can do enormous good with my life.¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†PLEASE HELP ME SAVE MY OWN LIFE.",

We want to help and allow Devon to experience life without restrictions. Please take the time to read this incredible young man's journey. He is wise beyond his years and stronger than most his age. ¬†¬†  \"On the morning of January 15th there was an accident in the weight room at Academy High School which resulted in the amputation of my pointer and middle finger. As you can imagine this has been very traumatic for me and some days are worse than others, and it will continue to get worse for me mentally for a little while. Actually varies moment by moment. I expect to return to school when I am released to do so. Due to the anxiety of this situation, I am asking to please not ask me questions about the accident when I return, it may cause me to replay the moment in my head and that won‚Äôt end well. I will open up and talk when I am ready, please respect my privacy and space. I look forward to returning to my normal activities but I will be learning my new normal. While I am prepared this will take some time, I will be very quiet and sad, and at times very frustrated, please just understand I need time but I know I will be stronger and better than ever before I know it. I will continue to be in athletics of course and this only inspires me to work harder in what I do, but I do hope the school district does what they should do to make the weight room safer. I am grateful because it could‚Äôve ended in worse circumstances. I am also extremely grateful it was me that it happened to instead of any of my fellow loved classmates, this way it‚Äôll bring the districts attention to the situation and they could easily prevent it from happening to anybody else. I‚Äôm very worried about everybody, but I understand everybody is worried about me as well, so thank you so much for your support and love during this extremely difficult time.

I came upon the idea that a lot of people that are affected by COVID-19 may not all have insurance or funds to help pay for the costs of treatment and related events. Along with time missed from not being at work due to sickness, funds may be in short supply. I have not fully planned where funds will go or how to distribute said funds. My idea is to donate the funds to an organization that is equipped to help those in need. I will decide on how funds will be distributed by Friday March 6, 2020. \r\n\r\n Any donation that is received will be appreciated by someone whose life depends on getting through sickness and returning to society.

Collectively, I knew we could do something about it. And we did: We wiped out lunch debt in schools across the state of Minnesota.  Today, we‚Äôre facing a bigger challenge. The coronavirus is hitting Washington hard. Unfortunately, 29 people have died and 366 people have tested positive, according to the Health. Government officials warn it could reach 64,000 in a few months if our leaders do not take the steps necessary to stop the spread of the virus.¬†  We hope and encourage our government officials to do all they can to test, treat, and prevent the spread of the coronavirus.¬†  People need immediate help. During this crisis, those with the least suffer the most. Some folks can‚Äôt go to the doctor because they don‚Äôt have healthcare. Public schools are closed for at least two weeks and some people can‚Äôt afford to take off work because they don‚Äôt have paid sick leave. Some parents have to choose between paying the rent and feeding their kids.¬†  This will get worse before it gets better. But the good news is that there‚Äôs a path forward.  You may wonder, like I have, if there‚Äôs anything we can do to help. We don‚Äôt have to sit idly by waiting for someone else to solve the problem. We can take action. We need to come together and lift up the folks that need a helping hand.¬†  I recently read about the Minnesota Foundation‚Äôs COVID-19 Response Fund. The Seattle Foundation is an important organization providing direct relief to those that need it most. They will provide money to ‚Äúresidents without health insurance and/or access to sick days, people with limited English language proficiency, healthcare and gig economy workers, and communities of color, among others.‚Äù The Fund is working closely with King County‚Äôs Pandemic Community Advisory Group to identify organizations currently providing or receiving requests for support and will use the money raised on our campaign to assist with these efforts.  I will not have access to the funds. Every dollar donated will be transferred directly to the Minnesota Foundation. Your donation is tax-deductible.¬†  Please join me in becoming part of the solution. Donate $5, $10, or $25 bucks. Every contribution counts.

            "description": " We Are The World   Outreach To Find   Cure COVID-19  We are raising money to test our proposed cure (clo2) for the pandemic known as covid-19. We think we already have a cure, but it must be tested on the the actual virus. All procedes will be used towards this end. CLO2 is the chemical compound that has proven to be effective in killing many bacteria   virus infections. The FDA has approved its use for many things including mouthwash, but refuses to approve it for it's health benefits. It's so  inexpensive  to buy that companies cannot sell it and make money. Anyone can make it by combining to compounds which are available world-wide.  Our non-profit group is ready to go anywhere to test the clo2 cure for this pandemic.¬† We just need the support   approval of the World Health Organization or the infected countries approval, to allow us to test it. Clo2 has been used for decades, but it's efficacy for medicine has never been proven,¬† due to the millions of dollars required by the FDA , CDC for companies to mass produce it.  The History of Chlorine Dioxide¬† ( CLO2  the proposed  cure  for COVID-19)   Chlorine Dioxide ¬†was discovered by Sir Humphrey Davy in 1844. The British chemist combined potassium chlorite with sulphuric acid. It will soon be discovered that this green gas would be a more effective disinfectant than chlorine.   By the 1930's Chlorine Dioxide  was being used more frequently for disinfecting areas. Because of it's gaseous form, it filled spaces evenly. The volitile gas was impossible to ship safely, so Sodium Chlorite began to manufactured as a relatively safe precursor chemical, and the industries using chlorine dioxide would then generate the gas onsite as needed. Because of Chlorine Dioxide's solubility in water, it starts being used as a water treatment.   In 1944, Chlorine Dioxide  was used by the City of Niagra New York, to control odor and remove phenols from the river water used as the municipal supply to good effect. The city soon changes to Chlorine Dioxide exclusively. The water is cleaner, tastes better, and has no odor compared to the use of chlorine.   In 1956 Brussels Belgium makes the switch from Chlorine to Chlorine Dioxide  for it's municipal water system. It is discovered that Chlorine dioxide will destroy algae biofilm, a feat which Chlorine could not accomplish.¬†   Through the 1960's  more cities and swimming pools start to change to  Chlorine Dioxide .   In 1967 The United States Environmental Protection Agency (E.P.A) registered an aquaeous form of Chlorine Dioxide  to be used as a sanitizer and disinfectant. Chlorine DIoxide starts being used commercially on fruit and produce as a sanitizer.   In the 70's and 80's The EPA began reccomending Chlorine DIoxide  over Chlorine for water treatment and other applications. This was due to the fact that because of their different chemical properties, Chlorine Dioxide was more efficient, and did not produce toxic trihalomethanes like chlorine.   In 1988 the EPA registered Chlorine Dioxide  as a sterilizer approved for hospitals, laboratories, and healthcare facilities   In 2001 FEMA and other government agencies use Chlorine Dioxide  to to decontaminate buildings contaminated with Anthrax. ¬†Chlorine Dioxide was completely effective against the tiny Anthrax Spores. The buildings, walls and furnishings suffered no damage from the treatment.   In 2005 FEMA again uses Chlorine DIoxide . This time to eradicate mold from damage caused by Hurricane Katrina. A restuarant in New Orleans was able to re-open after being treated for just 12 hours without major repair.   The products, uses, and applications for Chlorine Dioxide  continue to grow. More and more mainstream health and home related products are using chlorine dioxide. There are several patents issued for companies to use Chlorine Dioxide to make personal and household products.¬†   As of January 2020¬† the FDA, CDC,¬† and other US organizations continue to forbid use of Chlorine Dioxide  as a medicine because of a lack of interest for corporations to make enough money to market it as such.¬† Simpley said, the clo2 is so plentiful that anyone can make it. No company would ever be able to patent it. Therefore people die.  Will billions of people die now because it is too cheap for rich people to get richer? We suggest that one of the billionairs running for office donate clo2 to the world now!

Currently, we are in Xiamen, Fujian Province.\r\n \r\n\r\n We have two adopted dogs:      This is Munchies. He is 4 years old. We found him as a 2-month-old puppy in Beijing, Wudaokou area. He has been a part of our family since then.    And this one is our \"Girl\" aka Miss Paws. We found her starving on the street in September 2019, in Xiamen. We have been trying to find her a forever family but unfortunately, we couldn`t find anybody.¬† (The picture above is a part of the poster we prepared before for the adoption.) So, now she has become the newest addition to our family.  Until January 2020, everything was going nicely in our lives. But then,¬†  the Coronavirus outbreak has started and everything turned upside down.¬† We are living under a nationwide quarantine. Finding masks and supplies is difficult. People couldn`t go to work for almost a month.¬† Most companies resumed working on the 19th of February in most provinces, but schools are still closed and there is no specific starting date.¬†\r\n \r\n\r\n Out training center has been hurt by this deeply and we still have not gotten our salaries for January and February. Our management keeps telling us the only thing we can do is to wait until schools reopen, but even after that, there is no guarantee that they will pay us.¬†  Right now the only thing we are trying to do is get back to America, yet with our current financial situation, it is not possible. We need to buy plane tickets not only for us but for our pets which currently is more expensive given the situation.¬† Our options are limited by the lack of airlines flying to China.¬† Also, the paperwork which is required for our¬† dogs to get on the planes is very expensive. We had considered staying longer yet with our rent and daily expenses we are not able to support ourselves. We already used all our savings and currently, we are surviving by the money our families have lent us and need to find a solution as fast as possible.  This unexpected pandemic is hurting everybody in a different way. We¬† just want to go back home and be safe. Leaving our dogs behind is not an option.¬†   Please help us get home, we only have one month to finish everything and move our lives to America. We have lived here for five years and this has been one of the hardest things we have ever had to do. Our lives are here in China and to leave this all behind has been a challenge for us both mentally and physically.¬†  \r\n ",

As simple household medical supplies are being sold out and the current ones in stock have tripled their price and sometimes even quadruple, lower economy households will not be able to purchase these necessities themselves. So not only will these funds help with purchasing hazmat suits, but they will also help to give households around the U.S. simple things like hand sanitizer and soap.

My 15-year-old daughter reminded me that over the past month they have binged watched some shows on Netflix that kept them so enthralled that they actually stayed home for hours at a time.¬† I had an \"a-ha\" moment.¬†   So, this morning - after urging them to pack up their Vanagon and just go camping for the next month or two (they laughed that idea off) - I passed along a list of shows they could binge on Netflix, with the idea that this might keep them busy and help them to be more content staying home and not volunteering out in the community.¬†   They really love crime dramas, mysteries, thrillers, British mysteries and thrillers.¬† They are - at this very moment - watching Harlan Coben's \"Safe\"... but I know that soon they will run out of shows from my Netflix suggestions list to watch!  So, I am trying to raise some money for them to get subscriptions to BritBox, AcornTV and Hulu so that they can possibly get sucked in and forget that hours, days, weeks are passing by... all the while the Coronavirus can do its thing and my parents can remain healthy.  And while I am doing this a bit tongue in cheek, I am also doing it because I want my parents to know that they are cared about, valued and loved beyond measure.¬† Any donation you can make towards these entertainment subscriptions would be so appreciated.¬† Any suggestions or other ideas would be appreciated, too!

This novel Coronavirus is a contagious virus originated from Wuhan, China that can cause symptoms such as fever, cough, breathing difficulties, pneumonia, severe respiratory syndromes, and even death. It expanded rapidly after it was developed through different ways of transmission including animals to humans and humans to humans, just like how common cold is spread.  Several countries around the globe including Italy, China, United States, Japan, Australia, France, Germany, Canada, Singapore, Malaysia, Korea, and Finland were already found to be infected with this lethal virus. \r\n\r\nAccording to the Chinese government officials, this novel Coronavirus first appeared in a seafood market on December 12, 2019. Within a short month, the number of people who are confirmed to be infected with this coronavirus had already become 86,657 along with 2305 deaths. the W.H.O (World Health Organization) declared the outbreak of this novel Coronavirus to be a global health emergency. Starting from February 1, 2020, travel to China , Italy , Iran, South Correa was restricted and this would lead to huge economic downfalls in every single country. \r\n\r\n\r\nCurrently, tons of doctors and medical workers were fighting against the Coronavirus at the front line, and many of them had sacrificed their lives. With a tremendous amount of infected patients, China and many countries were facing medical shortages. Most of the hospitals in China desperately need supplies including masks, goggles, and protective suits. Without these types of equipment, the medical workers can be easily exposed to the Coronavirus and this can make the situation worse. \r\n\r\nSo, we need your help! We appreciate everyone that is willing to participate in this fundraiser and all of the generous contributions from you will be used to purchase protective medical equipment including protective suits, N95 masks, and medical goggles. All of these were in urgent need for those medical workers in the front line.

            "description": " Imagine being overseas in another country with your wife and son,¬† and finding out you have been stranded!  Government travel bans have caused Airlines to cancel tickets, without refunds/exchanges.    This Journey actually Began¬† way back in 2013. I came here to volunteer and help out. I taught, and helped multiple pastors during that time. I also married my best friend. She had been in my life, although from a distance for a long time. My time for departure was arriving and I was spending the last of my money I had extra over what i would need to eat, gas in car to get to work etc.     Dengue Fever  didn't care about any of that! A mosquito bit me contaminating my body with the Dengue Virus causing massive loss, along with a deadly brutal sickness.¬†     Missed flight-2013  was a horrid disaster. My visa expired a few days after the missed flight. While I laid sick bedridden my visa expired adding violation fees to the necessary extension fees. The Missed flight was a disaster. No money, and no way out. The airline even agreed to just let me standby fly out for another $150.00 if could leave that same week. Yet my body wracked with pains and fever was not up to the task of travel even if it meant getting better.   I Survived Dengue,  and after seven more months of living on an average of around $30.00 per month, losing nearly 80 lbs, I was helped by a great fellow from a church to make it back to the states.     Another Virus, CoronaVirus seeks¬† to wreak havoc in my life. That is why I brought up the Dengue experience. I lost my vehicles, tools for my business, furniture, clothes. I lost everything the first time with Dengue Fever. Due to being destitute I couldn't file papers to bring my wife home as we planned, being destitute meant leaving finally when I was helped, by myself to work and climb my way back up.  I paid all the loans back and slowly got back on my feet. It was a multiyear nightmare. Living on a hundred dollar per month food budget, no clothes budget, car budget, etc.    My family suffered being torn apart  for two years of only small contact with phonecards and Facebook Messenger.¬† Then at three years I was able to scrounge enough to visit 2 weeks on a poverty budget. The next year I filed papers to bring my wife and they told me I needed to prove I made enough, I thought well does the asylum seekers need enough financial support? They come mooching having never paid taxes, I have paid taxes since 14 years of age and never taken even unemployment. So this seems wrong, not saying don't help asylum seekers and those that need, but don't then discriminate against your own citizens. Her being here would increase income, and keep my earnings in the country instead of the need to send a big portion to her to live.   Today I sit scared  as my wife and son were finally going to come. With our last appointment at the embassy my wife is coming home! I want her to fly same flight, it cost a lot as most seats are booked on my flight.    Flight Canceled  with no recourse, or solution in sight. ¬†I don't have enough to replace my ticket, not even a dream or fantasy I will find a way or be blessed enough to get my wife and son replacement tickets too on a route and flight not canceled or high CoronaVirus locations.     I am asking,  even though I never have been a mooch and don't even know how, and really doubting anyone will care, and finding this hopeless, I am asking for your help.     Please¬† help me get home so I can work, pay my rent and not lose all that I have worked these long hard years to get back. If possible I would like to raise $1,000 to get the ticket with aisle seat(I'm wide wont fit in economy except aisle). Yes I am cheap I fly cheap seats except for choosing aisle. I don't know if that is enough even as each day the prices change, and with more and more canceled travelers looking I expect it to become higher.¬† That is the minimum, it will get me home to work, then hopefully In time I can get my wife a ticket and son and they will get home too.   Best option  would be finding way to bring them too by raising enough to pay their airfare also.¬† Her visa is at stake as she has a window to enter the USA and waiting excessive time they sometimes wont even grant the whole window. I leave that up to you folks. I am no mooch but I am desperate as I am work injured an cannot work for the monies I used to when younger and healthier. I wouldn't recover from losing everything again.   Some Pictures Follow   One thing Great Happened while stuck in the Philippines, I watched my son be delivered.¬† It happened at a small midwife clinic in middle of nowhere. Was scary, like out of the 1800's.    Last visit i was finally able to afford taking family and extended(2 sis in-laws and niece)to eat at a American quality equivalent restaurant. Was amazing cost around $16 per person but was better than any buffet i have been in America. They still are thankful, and smile so big when Vikings is brought up. For folks who make $2 or so a day with food costs at or around Americans(to buy they just don't buy the same foods eating lot cheaper than we do), they really appreciated it. As you can see I'm wearing a bulk pack white tee, I have learned from them to budget a lot more strictly.    For years I missed Birthdays and Christmas for not only my wife, but my son too. This was really hard for him. He wants to drive a backhoe so Papa can be home more. I cried when I heard that. I work hard, don't get drunk or waste money. Sometimes I wonder why has to be this hard. Work injury took my career away where I made enough to really provide a descent(not rich or even well off)life. I made 50-65k as a truck driver OTR.¬† I switched to a local job so i could be with family when they came but the Union company turned out to be a not a great choice.  I was hurt and was their fault they even admitted as much, I am permanently injured and Doctors say unlikely to drive a truck again. The company didn't even pay the light duty work. Just refused forcing me to have to work or die of starvation and family hate me when they can't eat because I didn't send money. My injury is real, my pain is real, yet because they could force me to have to work just to survive they haven't even paid the surgery that would fix my shoulder to a point it may be possible to work again at 30% chance.  Some say I have lived a life under a black cloud of bad luck, Eric a great friend of mine says he has never met anyone with as bad a luck as I have. I may have bad Luck and it may seem like there is no hope, so what, each day is a new day it may just get better.¬†  I for one would like to believe I am done missing birthdays and Christmas presents getting opened and seeing my son smile. He is honor role and does try so hard even he has ADHD so bad like his dad(me). We are teaching him to learn to self adjust so he can function normally, something I only learned about in twenties and have learned through personal experience does work, but takes work and time.     Hopefully Last Airport parting¬† was what I thought and believed before this travesty happened. Each time I flew out we took the pic here at the plaque outside the airport. Each time it was miserable and hard. Lost my house, all my business equipment and tools, clothes, just about everything else. I didn't lose the most important thing, my family. I may lost time I will never get back, but I still have my family. If you read this far please help, even its so small a gift, or just sharing to your church Facebook page etc.¬† I have never collected a dollar on one of these, but I have given hundreds to help others, I did it even broke as I was, I knew others might be better off, but that doesn't mean they care.  Thank you all for reading my sob story, it is hard and I thank you for your time, thank those who gave, I know you didn't have to, thank you.",

Currently, I‚Äôve been facing some hard ships here in South Korea due to the coronavirus outbreak. Due to my visa, I‚Äôm only allowed to work and apply for certain part time jobs after a certain point in time of living here. I‚Äôve been working random tutoring jobs and gigs to stay afloat while living here so far and I‚Äôve lost all of those students due to the Coronavirus outbreak here in South Korea. The country is in a state of emergency, and for myself and certain other expats, we can‚Äôt find work anywhere.¬†\r\n \r\n\r\n I‚Äôve worked so hard to secure my spot here in South Korea, and my spot at Korea University, an Ivy League university. School has also been delayed because of the virus, and I‚Äôm in such a state of limbo. We will start to attend classes online in 2 weeks but my lap top has been broken for months, and I have no money to fix it.¬†  My journey here in South Korea has already been financially challenging, but at this time I‚Äôm at a loss. Any donations to help keep myself a float at the moment are very appreciated. Everyone stay safe, and thank you for your kindness.  -Skylar :)\r\n ",

            "description": "Summary A new coronavirus named COVID-19 has spread across multiple continents and infected thousands of people. The virus has caused more than 3,000 deaths, primarily in China. Donations to this fund will help stop the spread of COVID-19 and support response efforts. (Please note: We cannot accept donations originating from Mainland China in accordance with the Law of the People's Republic of China on Administration of Activities of Overseas Nongovernmental Organizations.)  Challenge It is critical to stop the spread of the virus and provide medical care to those who need it. Patients and front-line medical responders in high-risk and quarantined areas need supplies and continued support as the crisis unfolds.  Solution Donations to this fund will bring services to affected communities and help stop the virus's spread. Initially, the fund will help meet immediate needs for healthcare, food, and water in partnership with our nonprofit partners. As the situation unfolds, it will transition to support longer-term education and recovery efforts run by local, vetted organizations in affected regions. We will work with our partners on the ground to allocate funds where they're most needed.  Long-Term Impact We believe that organizations that are deeply rooted in local communities are in the best position to provide long-term support for survivors of outbreaks and other crises. By funding the relief efforts of local organizations, donations to this fund have the potential to build stronger response capacity so that these organizations are better equipped to face future outbreaks. EmmaGiving will post reports about how funds have been used and will email these reports to donors.",

            "description": " Please share this gofundme with your friends. We need help   The \" Novel Coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) \" started in Wuhan and spread to the rest of China.  In Chengdu, Sichuan we didn't have many cases of the virus until recently. However now, the virus is spreading rapidly (over 450 confirmed cases) and Chengdu is now under almost complete lock-down by the Chinese authorities. It's the right thing to do, but it's causing massive problems.    By the time the virus lock-down was declared Chengdu stores had already been sold out of face masks, plastic suits and plastic gloves for many days . Now, by law, and enforced vigorously you can't leave your house without a mask, and you really shouldn't shop or do much else without plastic gloves or a plastic suit, but you just can't buy them anymore. ¬†  Workers can't work, companies can't open because only about 10% of workers are in Chengdu, the rest are stuck in their hometowns. Most stores aren't open. Without a mask you can't go anywhere. It's very bad for elderly people, they don't have the resources to help themselves.   I'm Canadian, and I've been living in Chengdu for about 4 years. I really love this city, and I want to help out. Because I'm a foreigner, many Chinese friends, and Chinese neighbors,¬† and even people I've never met before but have seen walking around my complex have been asking me if I have a source for masks and virus prevention supplies. I didn't but I have found a supply in Hong Kong.   Masks and plastic suits are desperately needed in Chengdu, for medical workers, essential workers and everyday people. People are washing masks and reusing them because of the shortage. Many people just can't afford to buy masks or can't find them to buy even if they have money.   I have found a source of masks, plastic suits, and plastic gloves in Hong Kong, and I can find a way to get them to Chengdu. Good masks cost about $1 per mask, while plastic suits are $3-4. I can get a much better price per unit if I buy more.¬†  My plan is to distribute the masks, plastic suits and plastic gloves to the poorer areas close to where I live (south Chengdu) and focus on the elderly, and people who need them the most. The more funds I can raise, the bigger area we can help. If we prevent even one person from getting infected that could prevent hundreds more later.¬†   My estimate is that $1000 will buy enough supplies to protect an entire block for a month. Of course, more would be better.¬† I'd love to raise more than that and expand the area and amount of time I can help. I do have friends who will help me distribute it, and our plans will be updated constantly depending on what's happening with the virus. I will also be cooperating with a couple of foreigner organizations here.   The COVID-19 virus is truly an epidemic already, especially in China. We need help immediately. Please help out by hitting the donate button. Every penny helps. If you can help out with $5, $10, $20, $100 it would be so appreciated by me, and by my Chinese neighbors.",

I'll get to the point: I'm working with organizations and people across the country to launch a powerful national network of people with chronic illnesses.  We need your support, your wisdom, and your love -- and if possible, financial contributions.  I've spent most of my life being a part of game-changing HIV, LGBTQ and justice movements.¬† I've founded deeply-effective organizations, coalitions and national networks. I've anchored teams of staff and volunteers, and held responsibilities for budgets and strategies from individual compassionate support to massive direct action.  I am honored to learn from and work with queer people of color who are the generative leaders of disability justice¬† and healing justice movements with the power to transform our society so we all can thrive. I'm a longtime health care activist and journalist with multiple chronic illnesses. I focus on the intersection of health, care and medical systems; structures of power, information and control; and self-organizing networks to mobilize community wisdom and love.  So now -- working with national networks and brilliant organizers, healers and medical professionals -- I'm building a vital network of people living with chronic illnesses and our allies.  We may call it Chronic Illness Leadership For Emergent Times (CIVFET). But what's most important is what we're going to do:  --  We are hosting a video meeting on Saturday.

(Thanks to AIDS United, Black Emotional and Mental Health collective (BEAM), The Counter Narrative Project , Positive Women's Network-USA (PWN-USA), ME Action for your co-sponsorship of the webinar.)  --  We've planned and initiated a rapidly-scalable plan for this network based on emergent strategies and mutual aid. We need your support to move forward as quickly and effectively as possible. As you know, people living with some chronic illnesses and disabilities are at greater risk of acquiring a coronavirus, having a more severe course of it and complications during or afterwards, and higher mortality rates.  And those facing oppression, marginalization and criminalization are most affected by heightened demands on health care systems and supply chains, economic turmoil, and rising stigma and bias.  (take a breath or a pause.)  But queer and trans people have always had to find new paths for our survival.¬† Our strategies for dealing with chronic illnesses, like our communities themselves, are diverse, creative and take nothing for granted.  We are building a small but amazing team of network strategists, health professionals and healers, facilitators, fiscal managers, disaster response pros, project managers and tech experts, communicators and media producers.  Your support goes directly to this team -- which are primarily queer and trans people living with multiple chronic conditions.  Thank you.",

            "description": "\r\n  We are fundraising for medical supplies to support hospitals in Zhejiang, China in their fight against the recent coronavirus outbreak.¬†  3/5 Final Update: This campaign has completed.  Financial and delivery information are available at   https://onedrive.live.com/?authkey=%21ADRpcWPLDO%2DXxTA id=8802A5DE2E5AC593%214777 cid=8802A5DE2E5AC593   . Please also refer to campaign updates for more details.¬†   Who are we?  We are alumni volunteers of Hangzhou Foreign Language School. We are working to support our hometown and our country in this Coronavirus outbreak.   How serious is this Coronavirus?  The recently identified Novel Coronavirus 2019(2019 n-CoV), a cousin of the SARS virus, has infected thousands of people since the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The virus has spread to a total of fifteen countries across four continents.¬†  Wuhan and more than¬† 14 other cities have been locked down and major tourist destinations have been shut down to contain the 2019 n-CoV outbreak. Despite the effort, up to Jan 27, 4581 people have been infected and 105 have died with 6973 suspected. 350,000 people are estimated to be infected by the beginning of February. Hospital services were near collapse under the pressure of people flooding in to be diagnosed and treated. Medical supplies run dangerously low.   Why Zhejiang?  Zhejiang, the province with the largest floating population, is experiencing rapid development of the epidemic and fast growing¬† number of patients. At the same time, its capital Hangzhou, has received hundreds of Wuhan passengers returning from abroad in the past few days and carried out quarantine, isolation and other prevention and control work. A number of hospitals have shouldered heavy responsibility of providing health observation, diagnosis and treatment for Wuhan passengers as well as Zhejiang passengers who flew back on the same flights.  In the past several days, the number of patients confirmed with coronavirus in Zhejiang Province increased dramatically. Zhejiang has become the third largest epidemic area in China. As of Jan 27, 2020, 173 cases of Zhejiang have been confirmed. Doctors and nurses are working around the clock with very little rest. The rapid growing outbreak has left hospitals in Zhejiang in urgent need of medical supplies such as protective suits, N95 masks, etc. We shall not leave the doctors and medical staff exposed in danger. Please join us to extend your love and help to them!¬†   How will your donation be used?¬†  Donate to help the doctors and nurses in the hospitals¬† get  sufficient medical supplies ! They are fighting to protect all of us,¬† and let‚Äôs give our support to protect them!   Due to merchandise availability, our volunteers will be making the purchase at their own expense to ensure we get the supplies, then the finance officer (Beneficiary of the campaign) will reimburse the amount as the invoices indicate. As a result, the withdrawal from the campaign will be going to our finance officer's own personal bank account.¬†   Your generous support will be first used to purchase  certified medical protective gears including ¬† protective suits and respirators  , and will be distributed to hospitals in Zhejiang, such as First Affiliated Hospital Zhejiang University, Second Affilated Hospital Zhejiang University, and Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital.¬†¬†   Our Plan to get the campaign's donations to the intended recipients  Our volunteers are divided into multiple teams: Campaign Finance, Supply Acquisition, Appraisal, Transportation and Hospital Connection.   Campaign Finance team is responsible for handling all monetary payment and reimbursement for the purchase.   Supply Acquisition team will purchase the certified medical supplies from merchants all over the world through our alumni network after appraisal and assessment by Appraisal team. This makes sure that we are only purchasing those that meet the hospital requirements and standards.   Hospital Connection team will reach out to hospitals in Zhejiang and collect their requirements on the specific protective gears and quantity needed, while Transportation team will coordinate on the delivery of supplies from our warehouses to the hospitals.  Regular updates will be posted on the progress of our purchase orders until all of our orders have been delivered.¬†    ËøëÊó•Êù•ÔºåÊñ∞ÂûãÂÜ†Áä∂ÁóÖÊØíÊÑüÊüìËÇ∫ÁÇéÁñ´ÊÉÖÁâµÂä®ÁùÄ‰∏ñÁïåÂêÑÂú∞Âçé‰∫∫ÁöÑÂøÉ„ÄÇ ÊµôÊ±üÔºå‰Ωú‰∏∫ÊµÅÂä®‰∫∫Âè£ËßÑÊ®°ÊúÄÂ§ßÁöÑÁúÅ‰ªΩ‰πã‰∏ÄÔºåÊ≠£Âú®Èù¢ÂØπÁñ´ÊÉÖÂèëÂ±ïËøÖÈÄü„ÄÅÁúÅÂÜÖÁóÖÊÇ£Êï∞ÈáèÂø´ÈÄüÂ¢ûÈïøÁöÑÈöæÂÖ≥„ÄÇ ÂêåÊó∂ÔºåÊù≠Â∑ûÂú®ËøáÂéªÂá†Êó•‰∏≠Êé•Êî∂‰∫ÜÊï∞Áôæ‰ΩçÂõΩÂ§ñËøîÂõûÁöÑÊ≠¶Ê±â‰πòÂÆ¢Âπ∂ËøõË°å‰∫ÜÊ£ÄÁñ´„ÄÅÈöîÁ¶ªÁ≠âÈò≤ÊéßÂ∑•‰ΩúÔºåÂ§öÂÆ∂ÂåªÈô¢ÂíåÊú∫ÊûÑÂú®‰øùËØÅÊµôÊ±ü‰∫∫Ê∞ëÂÅ•Â∫∑ÁöÑÂêåÊó∂ÔºåËÇ©Ë¥üËµ∑‰∫Ü‰∏∫Ê≠¶Ê±âÂêåËÉûÊèê‰æõÂÅ•Â∫∑ËßÇÂØüÂíåÊ≤ªÁñóÁöÑÈáç‰ªª„ÄÇ  ÁõÆÂâçÔºå ÊµôÊ±üÁúÅÂÜÖÁóÖÊÇ£Êï∞ÈáèÂ¢ûÈïøÂø´ÈÄüÔºåÂ∑≤Êàê‰∏∫ÂÖ®‰∏≠ÂõΩÁ¨¨‰∏âÂ§ßÁñ´Âå∫ „ÄÇÊà™Ëá≥2020Âπ¥1Êúà27Êó•ÔºåÊµôÊ±üÂ∑≤Á¥ØËÆ°Á°ÆËØäÊñ∞ÂûãÂÜ†Áä∂ÁóÖÊØí173‰æãÔºàÊúÄÊñ∞Áñ´ÊÉÖÊÉÖÂÜµËØ∑ËßÅÔºö https://3g.dxy.cn/newh5/view/pneumonia Ôºâ„ÄÇÊµôÊ±üÁöÑÂåªÂä°Â∑•‰ΩúËÄÖ‰ª¨Ê≠£Â§ú‰ª•ÁªßÊó•Âú∞Â•ãÊñóÂú®ÂâçÁ∫øÔºåÂø´ÈÄüÂ¢ûÈïøÁöÑÁñ´ÊÉÖÂ∑≤ÂØºËá¥ÊµôÊ±üÁúÅÂ§öÂÆ∂ÂåªÈô¢ÂåªÁñóÁâ©ËµÑÂëäÊÄ•ÔºåÊÄ•ÈúÄÈò≤Êä§Êúç„ÄÅN95Âè£ÁΩ©Á≠âÂåªÁñóÁâ©ÂìÅ„ÄÇÊàë‰ª¨Â∏åÊúõËÉΩÂ§üÂ∞ÜÁà±ÂøÉ‰∏éÁâ©ËµÑÂ∏¶ÂêëÊµôÊ±üËøôÂ§ßÊàòÂú∫ÔºåÂ∏ÆÂä©ÊµôÊ±üÁöÑÂåªÈô¢ÂèäÂåªÊä§‰∫∫ÂëòÂÖ±Âêå‰∏éÊñ∞ÂÜ†ËÇ∫ÁÇéÊäó‰∫âÔºÅ  ÊµôÊ±üÂåªÁñóÁâ©ËµÑÂëäÊÄ•Ôºå Âè£ÁΩ©Èò≤Êä§ÊúçÁº∫Âè£Â∑®Â§ßÔºö   ÂåªÈô¢Á∫∑Á∫∑ÂêëÁ§æ‰ºöËøõË°åÂãüÊçêÔºö     Á¨¨‰∏ÄÊâπÁâ©ËµÑÈááË¥≠Ôºö  ÊÇ®ÁöÑÁà±ÂøÉÊçêÊ¨æÈ¶ñÂÖàÂ∞ÜÁî®‰∫éÈááË¥≠ÂåªÁî®Èò≤Êä§ÊúçÂèäÂè£ÁΩ©„ÄÇÊàë‰ª¨Â∞Ü‰ºöÂú®ÊéàÊùÉÁªèÈîÄÂïÜÂ§Ñ‰∏•Ê†ºÁ≠õÈÄâÁ¨¶ÂêàÂõΩÂÆ∂Ê†áÂáÜÁöÑÁâ©ËµÑÂûãÂè∑ËøõË°åË¥≠‰π∞ÔºåÂπ∂Â∞ÜÁâ©ËµÑËµ†‰∫àÊµôÊ±üÁöÑÂåªÈô¢ÔºåÂ¶ÇÊµôÂ§ßÈôÑÂ±ûÁ¨¨‰∏ÄÂåªÈô¢ÔºåÊµôÂ§ßÈôÑÂ±ûÁ¨¨‰∫åÂåªÈô¢ÔºåÂíåÊµôÂ§ßÈôÑÂ±ûÈÇµÈÄ∏Â§´ÂåªÈô¢Á≠â„ÄÇ  ÂÖ∂‰ªñÂ∑≤Á°ÆËÆ§Áâ©ËµÑÈúÄÊ±ÇÁöÑÊãüÊçêËµ†ÂåªÈô¢ÂØπË±°Ôºö ÊµôÊ±üÁúÅ‰∫∫Ê∞ëÂåªÈô¢ Êù≠Â∑ûÂ∏ÇÁ¨¨‰∏Ä‰∫∫Ê∞ëÂåªÈô¢ ÊµôÊ±üÁúÅ‰∏≠ÂåªÈô¢ ÂòâÂÖ¥Â∏ÇÁ¨¨‰∏ÄÂåªÈô¢ ÊπñÂ∑û‰∏≠ÂøÉÂåªÈô¢ ‰∏¥ÂÆâÂ∏Ç‰∫∫Ê∞ëÂåªÈô¢ Ê∏©Â∑ûÂåªÁßëÂ§ßÂ≠¶ÈôÑÂ±ûÁ¨¨‰∏ÄÂåªÈô¢  ‰ª•‰∏ãÊòØÈÉ®ÂàÜÁâ©ËµÑËøêÈÄÅÁÖßÁâáÔºö          Êàë‰ª¨ÊòØË∞ÅÔºü   Êàë‰ª¨ÊòØÊù≠Â∑ûÂ§ñÂõΩËØ≠Â≠¶Ê†°Ê†°ÂèãÁöÑÊàêÂëòÔºåÊÉ≥Ë¶ÅË¥°ÁåÆËá™Â∑±ÁöÑ‰∏Ä‰ªΩÂäõÈáèÊîØÊè¥ÂÆ∂‰π°Ôºå‰∏∫Á•ñÂõΩÂä†Ê≤π„ÄÇ ¬† ËÅîÁ≥ª‰∫∫Ôºö Êù≠Â∑ûÂ§ñÂõΩËØ≠Â≠¶Ê†°Ê†°Âèã¬† Âë®ÊôüËåπ ella.as@gmail.com  ÂÄ°ËÆÆ‰∫∫ÂêçÂçïÔºö ÂàòÊôî¬† ¬† ¬† Êù≠Â§ñ96Â±ä Âë®ÊôüËåπ Êù≠Â§ñ05Â±ä Âê¥Ëæ∞Êô® Êù≠Â§ñ07Â±ä ÊûóÂ≠êÂäº Êù≠Â§ñ07Â±ä ÊùéËã•‰∫ë Êù≠Â§ñ08Â±ä ÊùéÂòâÊÄ° Êù≠Â§ñ09Â±ä Ê®äÊñ∞Á´π Êù≠Â§ñ10Â±ä È´òÊô®Èú≤ Êù≠Â§ñ10Â±ä ÈôàÊÄùÊØÖ Êù≠Â§ñ10Â±ä Ë©πÂ§©Âçó Êù≠Â§ñ10Â±ä  Ê≤àÂ©∑¬† ¬† ¬† Êù≠Â§ñ11Â±ä  Âè∂ÁÆÄÂâë Êù≠Â§ñ11Â±ä Âº†ÁæöÈ™ä Êù≠Â§ñ11Â±ä ËôûÈ¶•ÊüΩ Êù≠Â§ñ12Â±ä ÁÜäÂÆ∂ÂÆÅ Êù≠Â§ñ13Â±ä Èôà‰Ω≥¬† ¬† ¬† Êù≠Â§ñ13Â±ä Êú±Ëéâ¬† ¬† ¬† ÊµôÂ§ß12Â±ä  Ë¥¢Âä°Ë¥üË¥£‰∫∫Ôºö Ëµµ‰∏ÄÊâ¨ Êù≠Â§ñ05Â±ä  Êàë‰ª¨Â∞ÜÂÆöÊúüÂÖ¨Â∏ÉÁ≠πÊ¨æËøõÂ±ï‰∏éÂéªÂêëÔºåÂπ∂Á°Æ‰øùÂ∞ÜÊî∂Âà∞ÁöÑÊâÄÊúâÊ¨æÈ°πÂÖ®ÈÉ®Áî®‰∫éÈááË¥≠Èò≤Ê≤ªÁñ´ÊÉÖÊâÄÈúÄÂåªÁñóÁâ©ËµÑ„ÄÇ   3Êúà5Êó•Êõ¥Êñ∞ÔºöÊ≠§Ê¨°ÂãüÊçêÊ¥ªÂä®Â∑≤ÁªèÂÆåÁªì„ÄÇ Êî∂ÊîØÂèäÁâ©ËµÑÈÄÅËææ‰ø°ÊÅØÂÖ¨ÂºÄÂèØËßÅÔºö  https://onedrive.live.com/?authkey=%21ADRpcWPLDO%2DXxTA id=8802A5DE2E5AC593%214777 cid=8802A5DE2E5AC593   ÂêåÊó∂ËØ∑ËßÅÊ¥ªÂä®Ê∂àÊÅØÊõ¥Êñ∞‰∫ÜËß£Êõ¥ËØ¶ÁªÜÁöÑÂÜÖÂÆπ„ÄÇ ¬†  Êàë‰ª¨Áõ∏‰ø°ÔºåÂú®ÂπøÂ§ßÊµ∑Â§ñÂçé‰∫∫„ÄÅÊµôÊ±ü‰∫∫„ÄÅÊÇ®ÁöÑÂ∏ÆÂä©‰∏ãÔºåÊàë‰ª¨‰∏ÄÂÆöÂèØ‰ª•Â∏ÆÂä©ÂõΩÂÜÖÂêåËÉûÂÖ±ÂêåÊàòËÉúÊñ∞ÂûãÂÜ†Áä∂ÁóÖÊØíÔºÅ    ÁâπÂà´ÊÑüË∞¢ÔºöÈòøÈáåÂÖ¨ÁõäÔºåÊµôÊ±üÂ§ßÂ≠¶Ê≥¢Â£´È°øÊ†°Âèã‰ºöÔºåÂåó‰∫¨Â§ßÂ≠¶Ê≥¢Â£´È°øÊ†°Âèã‰ºö„ÄÇ   Â§áÊ≥®Ôºö ÊçêÊ¨æÁªìÁÆóÊó∂ÔºåÊÇ®ÂèØ‰ª•ÈÄâÊã©ÁªôÊçêÊ¨æÂπ≥Âè∞È¢ùÂ§ñÂä†Â∞èË¥πÔºå‰πüÂèØ‰ª•ÈÄâÊã©0ÂÖÉÂ∞èË¥π„ÄÇ\r\n ",

Patients and front-line medical responders in high-risk and quarantined areas need supplies and continued support as the crisis unfolds.\r\n\r\nDonations to this fund will bring services to affected communities and help stop the virus's spread. Initially, the fund will help meet immediate needs for healthcare, food, and water in partnership with our nonprofit partners. As the situation unfolds, it will transition to support longer-term education and recovery efforts run by local, vetted organizations in affected regions. We will work with our partners on the ground to allocate funds where they're most needed.\r\n\r\nWe believe that organizations that are deeply rooted in local communities are in the best position to provide long-term support for survivors of outbreaks and other crises. By funding the relief efforts of local organizations, donations to this fund have the potential to build stronger response capacity so that these organizations are better equipped to face future outbreaks. GlobalGiving will post reports about how funds have been used and will email these reports to donors.\r\n\r\nGreetings to you all,",

Saygƒ±larƒ±mla, Orkun  ----------------------  Dear readers,  Since Covid-19 has hit the world and continues to spread, we are in the middle of the info pollution both on traditional and social media.  Last February, I found myself in a difficult situation where I spend a lot of time to differentiate the correct information from the unreliable ones. Also, I noticed my friends or family members in Turkey, who cannot speak English, did not have one single platform where they can follow the news about SARSCoV2.  That‚Äôs why I decided to set up a website, where I collect the updates and information from official sources such as the World Health Organization, official bodies or reliable news organizations:   https://coronavirusu.net/  ¬†  The website is in Turkish for various reasons: ‚Ä¢ There are a lot of people in Turkey can‚Äôt follow the English-language sources. We translate them for the Turkish speaking people. ‚Ä¢ Information pollution is even bigger when we don‚Äôt reach the first source and under the censorship.  My main motivation is to convey official updates and confirmed information to people from reliable sources. I am not adding any personal, political, ideological opinon of anyone. Also, each source used in the website is certainly cited in the website. I thought I can finance it with ads but so far the profit is 22.85 TRY(roughly 3.5 EUR). Therefore I want to get rid of them to avoid distractions.  I need support in order to continue my activities such as following the news, updating the website, making the translations and maintaining the technical aspect of the website.   For all the questions and advices you can directly contact me via 2019koronavirusu@gmail.com  Kind regards, Orkun",

Dr. Jefferies is working towards creating and testing a safe and effective vaccine for the novel coronavirus, COVID-19. His approach is explained here:    https://globalnews.ca/video/6622294/ubc-research-teams-work-on-high-performance-covid-19-vaccine    In January 2020, a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was identified as the cause of an outbreak of pneumonia originating in Wuhan, China and has since spread to at least 89 countries and territories around the world.¬†Small-molecule anti-viral ¬†therapies targeting different stages of the corona virus lifecycle may be¬†effective in treating COVID-19, however, in the absence of an effective vaccine, the probability of containment is low and the world must be¬†prepared for a pandemic. Therefore, the rapid¬†development of protective vaccines against COVID-19 has become a societal priority but remains a scientific challenge. The ideal COVID-19 vaccine would elicit highly potent neutralizing antibody responses against a broad spectrum of emerging COVID-19 viral strains; induce protection against infection and transmission; and be safe by not inducing any harmful immune or inflammatory responses. These are particular challenges in vaccination against viruses such as COVID-19. This funding initiative builds upon groundbreaking research by Dr. Jefferies and his team on vaccines against Rubella, West Nile Virus, Smallpox, Influenza, and Cancers and seeks to create and test a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine for rapid implementation.¬†  The Sullivan Urology Foundation supports Dr Jefferies in his work at UBC and the Vancouver Prostate Centre and is partnering with this GoFundMe in support of the development of a COVID-19 vaccine.¬† The Sullivan Urology Foundation provides financial support to the Department of Urologic Sciences at the University of British Columbia for basic scientific translational and clinical research.¬†   http://www.urologyfoundation.ca/  ",

To stop the propagation of the virus hand washing is the most effective way. Beside medical personnel, anyone in contact with the general public it is likely to become a carrier by spreading the virus through their hands. There are some hidden group of people who handle other people and their belongings all day long, for them to wash their hands as required is not possible. For them hand sanitiser is the answer, E.I. shop assistance, working with the elderly / kids, etc  A medical centre has gone through 50 standard dispensers in a week, I have ready the labour (volunteers), the tools and location to produce hand sanitiser that it will be distributed freely to schools, nursing homes, childcares, local shop assistance and any other people in need. I do this mainly to stop the propagation of the virus not to become a pandemic, I hope other people will come on board or follow this sample to be able to made enough to cover the whole region to keep the virus controlled. I truly believe that as individuals living in a society, we need to do our best to help our society when needs its individuals.  I already have $1000 but need another $10,000, so I can make a minimum purchase of ingredients from a bulk distributor, this will allow to prepare around 550 litres of hand sanitiser that will be equal to 11000 standard dispensers (50ml each). I just need contributions to buy the ingredients. As soon as I have the fund, I will be able to start the distribution of hand sanitiser within 3 days",

And people with chronic illnesses need specific strategies.  I'll get to the point:   I'm working with organizations and people across the country to help launch a powerful national network of people with chronic illnesses.    --  We need your support, your wisdom, and your love -- and if possible, financial contributions.  --      What We're Doing:  For now, we're calling it Chronic Illness Leadership For Emergent Times (CILFET). But what's most important is what we have done and will do  --  We hosted a video meeting on Saturday, March 7 that's now a  Healing Justice Podcast episode   ---  Thanks to: PeoplesHub, AIDS United, BEAM (Black Emotional and Mental Health Collective) Counter Narrative Project, Health Justice Commons, #MEAction Network, Positive Women's Network - USA and The Reunion Project  And to our webinar speakers, facilitators, promoters, strategists and producers Kate Werning of Healing Justice Podcast, Evvie Ormon of EmergingPhoenix consulting, Dr. Crissaris Sarnelli, Elandria Williams of PeoplesHub, Emily Szklarski, Joan Dark, Kate Sorensen, Andrew Reynolds,¬† and Daisy Becerra.  --  We have materials from the webinar and resources up at  bit.ly/cilfetstuff.¬†   --  We will continue hosting and supporting mutual aid and conversations centering people with chronic illnesses and disabilities  --  We're planning and initiating a rapidly-scalable plan for this network based on emergent strategies and mutual aid. We need your support to move forward as quickly and effectively as possible.  Why We are Doing This:  As you know, people living with some chronic illnesses and disabilities are at greater risk of acquiring a coronavirus, having a more severe course of it and complications during or afterwards, and higher mortality rates.  And those facing oppression, marginalization and criminalization are most affected by heightened demands on health care systems and supply chains, economic turmoil, and rising stigma and bias.  (let‚Äôs all take a breath or a little pause‚Ä¶)  But queer and trans people have always had to find new paths for our survival. Our strategies for dealing with chronic illnesses, like our communities themselves, are diverse, creative and take nothing for granted.  We are building a small but amazing team of network strategists, health professionals and healers, facilitators, fiscal managers, disaster response pros, project managers and tech experts, communicators and media producers. We want to situate this vital network in a stable home or formation so it can do what it needs to do.  Your support goes directly to help this team do what we need to do -- which are primarily queer and trans people living with multiple chronic conditions.  Thank you.   GoFundMe has asked for people raising funds about COVID-19 to provide this specific information:    1. Who you are: JD Davids    2. Where you're from: I live in Brooklyn, NY    3. Your relationship to the parties you're raising funds for: They are for myself and a small team working on this effort. (see next question).    4. How the funds will be spent (be specific as possible): The funds will be used to donate to the small team of people who I am working with who are giving up time on other paid work or who are working with low pay to launch this important network. It includes me, and a social media and communications manager who lives in New Jersey, an artist and filmmaker in Utah, a recent graduate school graduate in New Orleans with a degree in disaster response, an organizer in Brooklyn who also works part time at a radical bookstore, and will include one of two people in NYC I am talking to who are experts in creating networks and sustainable cooperative groups.

            "description": "As you may know, the grave situation in Wuhan and China continue to worsen by the day. Currently, the government is mass quarantining people who have been infected in poor conditions and in places that were not designed to house large amounts of people for long periods of times (i.e sports stadiums, exhibits, etc). There is a growing shortage of basic medical supplies such as masks and medical kits for proper diagnoses‚Äîthis is expected to only be exacerbated with the continued lock down and eventually include food, water, etc. In most parts of China there is a significant shortage of masks and other protective wear, making the prevention and protection of civilians increasingly challenging.   We can not afford to allow basic protection/resources be the reason this mass spreads, kills more on a global scale and further impact the global economy.¬† In 2003, SARS cost the global economy¬† $40B.¬† At that time, China's GDP was¬† 25% ¬†of what it is today.¬†  Did you know?  Masks should be changed out every four hours in order to prevent virus from contaminating/penetrating the mask.   \r\n\r\nDue to shortages of medical kits the numbers are currently very underreported (31k diagnosed, 600+ deaths as of 2/6) and hospitals are forced to turn people away due to these shortages and hospital overcrowding.\r\n\r\nFor those who don‚Äôt know me, my name is Alice and I am from the greater Philadelphia area. I currently reside in San Francisco. 100% of the money raised will go towards the procuring and shipping supplies from the US to less urban areas of China where they are most challenged with basic resources to keep themselves safe.  My mom is currently in a small town (Jiangxi province) and has a group of volunteers that are willing to travel to neighboring towns to deliver and donate masks and other supplies to local hospitals.   This plan is set to evolve depending on how much we are able to raise. The more ambitious goal is to air ship supplies directly there (multiple times). Cost estimates and potential impact below (based on amazon prices--will also be researching wholesalers to improve quantities):  - $8,000  can buy ~ 2,200   N95 masks  that can be distributed to hospitals and quarantine facilities (to be used to protect nurses and doctors) - $8,000  can buy  40,000 flu masks  that will be distributed for civilian protection - $30,000  can buy  7,200 8 oz.  hand sanitizers -air ship cost: TBD. Placeholder for $5k for now.  Anything helps!! Thank you in advance!!\r\n\r\nUpdate Feb 13th: purchased and shipped 10 boxes of N95 masks via amazon ($1450)\r\n\r\nUpdate March 6th: first two boxes have arrived!!\r\n\r\nUpcoming plans: sending hand sanitizers to Wuhan directly to my cousins address for donations to local hospitals and schools.",

About two months ago he was diagnosed with Guillain-Barr√© syndrome if you don‚Äôt know what that is, it‚Äôs is a serious health problem that occurs when the body's defense (immune) system mistakenly attacks part of the peripheral nervous system. This leads to nerve inflammation that causes muscle weakness or paralysis and other symptoms. That day I cried my eyes out and my whole world turned upside down. But when I looked at Liam he had the greatest joy and giggled when I said peek a boo, your my little sunshine. It breaks my heart knowing that one day my baby boy could die. But he is stronger than anything in the whole wide world and he has a heart\r\nOf gold. For the past two months I have been going to specialists and surgeons and doctors appoints to get some info on how it gets better and about two\r\nDays ago Dr. Leung contacted me and said there is an experimental treatment but because he is so young it will cost a lot of money and me and my wife Lauren can‚Äôt handle the cost. The surgery is Spinal tap (lumbar puncture). A small amount of fluid is withdrawn from the spinal canal in your lower back. The fluid is tested for a type of change that commonly occurs in people who have Guillain-Barr√© syndrome. That alone cost us $18,000. But that‚Äôs not the problem the treatment is Immunoglobulin therapy. Immunoglobulin containing healthy antibodies from blood donors is given through a vein (intravenously). High doses of immunoglobulin can block the damaging antibodies that may contribute to Guillain-Barr√© syndrome. And cause it to dissipate to the point where he is clean and healthy and it cost us around $73,450. This treatment could allow me to be able to teach my son Liam how to play baseball ‚öæÔ∏è and I would truly love that just as much as he would love to go to the park and enjoy life.

Tastes like a margarita and it'll \"getcha\".   Part 4) Snort through nostril 50¬† droplets of the Active Virus.¬† Followed by another Corona Fog Cocktail with 100 stiff droplets of the Virus.¬†  - 24 hours later determine whether Test Subject contracted virus¬† (regardless continue with experiment to see if conditions worsen)¬†    All Parts above will be time stamped, video recorded, and verified as  authentic by a notary of the public.¬† ¬†  Video recordings will be released via Youtube four weeks after the time stamp of Part 4 commencement -- as soon as snorting the virus¬† begins.¬†   The CDC provides,¬†  People can fight stigma and help, not hurt, others by providing social support. Counter stigma by learning and sharing facts. Communicating the facts that viruses do not target specific racial or ethnic groups and how COVID-19 actually spreads can help stop stigma.   This experiment does all that, and more.¬†   Help us ... Help you ... and in turn ... Help the world.¬†         \r\n ",

The Kulen Elephant Forest opened its doors to the public on the 16th of December 2019.  By shifting the focus of animal-based tourism to conservation and retiring the world‚Äôs most famous riding elephants, we take great pride in having been able to make such a statement. They are now in a safe haven, living a beautiful life at the Kulen Elephant Forest.   ¬†But we are more than a safe home for the Elephants, we are an opportunity for the community; to improve education, conserve the natural world and bring everyone together in trying to preserve the remaining elephants of Cambodia.  Today, this vision is under threat. The outbreak of the CoViD-19 has negatively impacted Cambodia‚Äôs tourism in such a way that we are now fearful. Fearful that we now may struggle to sustain ourselves alone. Our self-sustaining model relied on tourism to finance our basic operations, and being so new, we did not have the time to save enough for this kind of contingency.  ¬†We need YOUR HELP to care for them.   Especially our oldest elephants who need more food, supplements and medical supplies.  ¬† $1000 = cost to care for 1 elephant per month  $20 = daily food cost for 1 elephant  $10 = daily medical cost for 1 elephant.

I thought the media was just panicking.\r\n \r\n\r\n But 2 days ago my friend Mike got the coronavirus in Italy. He was there on vacation with his family, now doctors forbid even to visit him.  After that, I wondered what I could do to help fight the virus. What can we do?\r\n \r\n\r\n But we can do a lot!  COVID-19 is a fairly strong virus with high persistence, which increases in hematologic progression. The only thing that mankind can do at the moment is to have a vaccine that will take 5 years or more to develop (along with trials).   Now mankind can only prevent it from spreading so fast. To do so, you need to reduce contact with humans and wear masks.   At the moment, people in Europe are in great need of masks. As in Korea, especially China. But Europe was not ready for such a rapid spread of the virus, so they now have an acute shortage of masks.  That's why we want to help with our own means as well as to attract donors to buy/create N95 masks and send them to Europe. To countries such as Italy, France, Germany, and others.\r\n \r\n\r\n In this environment, many speculators have appeared. Which inflates the prices of masks ten times. Not everyone can afford these masks.  But we plan to send more than MILLIONS of masks.   Every cent is important to us.  Stop the virus spreading together!\r\n ",

We are in respectable physical health and BELIEVE our immune systems are resilient. We are saddened to see so many people terrified and so few that are willing to help; do to fear and rightly so. We feel the need to do what is on our hearts and volunteer to suit up and go to Battle with this Epidemic. ¬†To start, we want to offer our services to completely disinfect areas around King, Pierce, Snohomish County, and surrounding areas. ¬†No job too small or big, we would firstly like to focus on places centered on those with already compromised immune systems, people who have self-quarantined and need some extra help to disinfect their location¬† Communal gathering Places, Schools, and Churches. Stores and restaurants \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe ask YOU to please consider a donation of even 5$ to support attainment the costly supplies needed to do this job!!

We are asking for a goal of $15,000 to allow us to purchase these needed tools ASAP and get to Work!!\r\n\r\nAs long as the donations allow it we will be working nonstop going to the front lines with our weapons of mass destruction until the coronavirus has left the building! Services will be complimentary for those who cannot afford it. Period. LET‚ÄôS DO THIS.\r\n\r\nWho are we? Just a small group of Janitorial Workers, and Property Maintenance and management personnel who are healthy and not crippled by fear, who are willing to do the job that very few are willing to do, we will update regularly on what our team is doing to help slow and stop this virus from spreading any further.¬†¬†Thank you and God bless, if you cannot donate please share!",

            "description": "Unfortunately its all come down to this. After a 10 day trip visiting my family in Florida I had what appeared to be a panic attack on January 27th on my way back home across the country to Arizona. A shortness of breath came over me,my blood pressure rose, and my heart started palpitating like crazy. Needless to say I thought I was having a heart attack and was going to die.  ¬† ¬† I had a connecting flight in Dallas but sent my luggage through to Arizona and got taken to the hospital. They did loads of blood tests, nasal swab, the works. Everything came back normal and they sent me on my way.  ¬† ¬†The next day I woke up with a really dry mouth and a fever in the hotel, that tightness in my chest was still there and I felt as though I couldn't breathe but this time I was alone. ¬† ¬†This is all in the midst of the Coronavirus scare so I was somewhat worried especially since I was in the same hospital as the Texas first case. Before many Americans were taking it seriously. I had a choice to make; go home thousands of miles from my family or get my flight changed and get to the bottom of this.  ¬† ¬† Fast forward to now. I've been to the E.R. 4 times and saw my primary care for the first time last week. I had another fever and dry mouth and a dry cough for the first time. They tested me for the flu and it came back negative. ¬† ¬†Now everyday my breathing has been getting worse. Then I find out that COVID-19 has shown up in Florida cities away from eachother with no travel history of patients. I've attempted to get tested for COVID-19 but it all failed despite being at three seperate international airports and Florida hotspots before travel restrictions were implemented. Somehow I still dont fit the testing criteria.  ¬† ¬†Now I'm with my family who is trying to be cool and collected but I feel I'm just a burden. I have no income and one weeks woth of clothes. Whats worse is I'm seeing them getting sick as well and they're trying to ignore it. I'm now stuck with medical bills and dont think I'll be able to make it and pay them. I lost my job over this illness and just want to be able to keep my family comfortable if I die.  ¬† As much as I hate sob stories and begging for money I ask you fine folk to please get the word about this out there. I would hate for my community to fall victim to such a terrifying disease. I'll keep updates via youtube most likely. If anyone has any medical supplies they would be willing to spare that would also be appreciated. ¬† ¬† If I'm able to get tested for COVID-19 before this gets any worse I'll update you. If I find out what's actually happening I'll update you. If I get quarantined I'll update you. I just want to keep my loved ones safe. As should all of you. ¬† ¬† Any advice on where to support COVID-19 patients would be very helpful as well because I would like to put 20% of donations toward families affected by COVID-19. As a hurricane Katrina survivor I understand what its like to be in an idle position where you feel hopeless and helpless. I dont want my loved ones to be in that position ever again.

Donations to this fund will help stop the spread of COVID-19 and support response efforts. (Please note: We cannot accept donations originating from Mainland China in accordance with the Law of the People's Republic of China on Administration of Activities of Overseas Nongovernmental Organizations.  Challenge    It is critical to stop the spread of the virus and provide medical care to those who need it. Patients and front-line medical responders in high-risk and quarantined areas need supplies and continued support as the crisis unfolds. ¬†  Solution    Donations to this fund will bring services to affected communities and help stop the virus's spread. Initially, the fund will help meet immediate needs for healthcare, food, and water in partnership with our nonprofit partners. As the situation unfolds, it will transition to support longer-term education and recovery efforts run by local, vetted organizations in affected regions. We will work with our partners on the ground to allocate funds where they're most needed. ¬†  Long-Term Impact    We believe that organizations that are deeply rooted in local communities are in the best position to provide long-term support for survivors of outbreaks and other crises. By funding the relief efforts of local organizations, donations to this fund have the potential to build stronger response capacity so that these organizations are better equipped to face future outbreaks. gofundme will post reports about how funds have been used and will email these reports to donors .",

In addition, I'd love an opportunity to play in the $10,000 Main Event (which usually offers approximately $8 million in 1st place winnings, with $1 million for those who make the 9 handed final table).¬†¬†  Also, a $55,000 Bankroll ($50k for tournament buy-ins...$5k for expenses during the 7 weeks playing tournaments) would allow me enough expense money to get me through the 7 week WSOP summer.¬† I'd be staying at The Budget Suites (kitchenettes run around $300 a week, I'd be driving my own vehicle to Las Vegas, and of course food would be included in this.¬† I've never been a big party guy..in other words, I'd be down there for poker...not to experience the 'what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas).  In return for raising this $55,000...I'd be willing to give 50% of my winnings to charity (why?¬† Because without the ability to raise this money, I would not have an opportunity to play a number of these events.¬† If The Corona Virus becomes much more serious in America, I'd like to devote a significant portion of the 50% of my winnings to Corona Victims, particularly senior citizen victims who are the most vulnerable to The Corona Virus.¬†  While I'm far from being one of the best poker players in the world, one is able to google my name (just type in Paul Lentz Poker..and you'll see that I do have some decent results over the years playing.¬† In other words, I have¬† it in me to make a few deep runs if the cards run right).¬†  If I'm able to raise the money to play in Vegas, I'll post my progress throughout the day on Facebook.¬† Each tournament offers chip count updates regularly for each tournament on The WSOP website.¬†¬†  I'd be happy to discuss this much more in depth...if I'm able to raise this money.¬† It's always been a dream of mine to have a bankroll like this just for The WSOP...as well as an opportunity to do some good with my winnings IF I'm able to run/play well this summer!

            "description": "\r\n  Help us fight the CoronaVirus by donating! \r\n \r\n\r\n  What is Covid-19 ‚Äì the illness that started in Wuhan?  It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city.   What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?  The virus can cause pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.   Is the virus being transmitted from one person to another?  China‚Äôs national health commission has confirmed human-to-human transmission, and there have been such transmissions elsewhere.   How many people have been affected?  As of 6 March, the global death toll was 3,404, while more than 100,000 people have been infected in more than 80 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.  The death toll has passed 3,000 in China, where there have been over 80,000 cases. South Korea, the nation worst hit by the outbreak outside China, has had 6,593 cases. More than 55,000 people in China have recovered from Covid-19.   Why is this worse than normal influenza, and how worried are the experts?  We don‚Äôt yet know how dangerous the new coronavirus is, and we won‚Äôt know until more data comes in. The mortality rate is around 2% in the epicentre of the outbreak, Hubei province, and less than that elsewhere. For comparison, seasonal flu typically has a mortality rate below 1% and is thought to cause about 400,000 deathseach year globally. Sars had a death rate of more than 10%.  Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population ‚Äì elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems ‚Äì to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important. One sensible step is to get the flu vaccine, which will reduce the burden on health services if the outbreak turns into a wider epidemic.\r\n \r\n\r\n  Why we want to help?  As you may be aware, people¬†all across the globe are flocking to grocery stores and wholesale clubs as the number of coronavirus cases continues to grow. Those of us who are fortunate enough to be able to go and buy in bulk,¬†everything we need, such as; masks, gloves, canned foods, hand sanitizer etc. are fine, but as this continues, the price gouging continues as does the major retail stores facing short to long term shortages. We want to help those who are not fortunate enough to able to take these basic cautionary steps, whether the reason is they are elderly, homeless, simply can not afford it or have mobility issues.\r\n \r\n\r\n  What we want to do to help fight the virus?  Our main focus is to keep supplying what is needed in order for all of us as a community to fight this. This is why we will be using the money you generously donate, to lease a factory warehouse, purchase the machines and equipment necessary to manufacture N95 Respiratory masks, gloves, overall protective wear, hand sanitizers as well as be able to source and stock on canned foods and the essentials we all need to protect ourselves and stay healthy.  Thank you for taking your time to read through and we hope you donate to help us!  Please contact us for any questions you may have!  \r\n ",

            "description": "The coronavirus disease started in December 2019. It was first identified in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province in China. The study so far shows that it originated from another animal and subsequently spread between people. Symptoms may include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Up to now, there is no vaccine or specific treatment. Patients are treated with symptoms management and supportive therapy.   Up to Feb 21, 2020, over 75,000 people were diagnosed as patients of coronavirus disease. 2236 people died. Since the first week of the outbreak, the medical supplies have been in shortage. None of the hospitals had enough reserves of medical materials. A lot of medical workers and volunteers were almost unprotected.     As young adults, we want to do something for them. Before this benefit concert, we raised around $12,000 and connected with a hospital in Huanggang. The good news is that the supplies we purchased departed on Feb 21 from Chicago to China. And Huanggang Central Hospital will receive them within a few days.¬†    Please click the link below   for more info of Benefit Concert for Coronavirus Relief at Bard College:   https://www.facebook.com/ziyue.he.9828/posts/101526228115263?__tn__=K-R      Speech from President Leon Botstein at the beginning   With the generous support of Bard College and Bard College Conservatory of Music, we organized a benefit concert within ten days and the result was so inspiring and optimistic that went beyond our expectation.

[...] I have been working tirelessly day and night for the past two weeks alongside my colleagues at St. Anna hospital in Brescia. The hospital is full, the intensive care unit is full. Every day we get more patients fighting Coronavirus but our resources are finished. I am not talking about face masks or hand gel. I am talking about oxygen, and breathing machines for pneumonia, and antiviral treatments.¬† \r\n[...] \r\nThis means every day me and my colleagues have to choose. We choose who gets treatment, and who just has to go home and wait. Like in wartime.\"\r\n\r\nThis is part of a message shared by a friend at the forefront of the current outbreak in Lombardy, Italy.¬† \r\n\r\nI am from a small town close to Brescia, but I live in the UK. My whole family still lives there.\r\nI woke up last Sunday to the news that the whole region was quarantined. Nobody in, nobody out.\r\nA couple of phone calls were enough for me to understand the severity of the situation, and to feel the urge to help, which is why I created this page.\r\n\r\nOver 5000 people tested positive to COVID-19 in the past two weeks in Italy, including 10% of the health professionals who are working to contain the emergency.¬† \r\n\r\nIn the most affected northern area, 95% of the total intensive care beds are taken. \r\n\r\nMore beds, more medical equipment, more medications are necessary to end this. The sooner this ends in Italy, China, and all worst-hit regions, the smaller the chance the virus reaches your Country, your City, and your family. \r\n\r\nPlease help with whatever you can today. \r\n\r\nAll donations will go to Azienda Ospedaliera Spedali Civili di Brescia, and will be used to purchase equipment and medications to treat COVID-19.

As you are already aware of, the whole world has been concerned about the newly rise yet dangerous virus called coronavirus (Covid-19), which creates lung problems. Originated in Wuhan, China, the virus has spread throughout every continent, infecting more than 75000 people with 2009 killed as of February 19, 2020. The World Health Organization has declared the virus ‚Äúa global threat.‚Äù And we need to help those in need of basic medical supplies to prevent the spread of the virus. I want to address this issue to my home country, Mongolia, which no cases declared so far. Here, although many people are aware of the disease and try to take precautions, there are some ‚Äì especially THE POOR - who do not have the fair chance to access the most basic safety. Because of the virus, the cost of face masks has risen dramatically; worse still, they are out of stock in many areas due to different reasons. The situation creates a huge disadvantage for the needy. I am organizing this fund to buy masks from the overseas and give them to the people in poor areas in Mongolia which are currently facing a huge shortage of masks. My goal is to get $10,000 for this fund; and we need to act quickly since the price of masks is changing constantly due to the shortage. The money will then be sent to a doctor that I have contact with to buy masks; then the masks will be sent back to some friends of mine in Mongolia who will help me distribute them to poor people. Thank you for your consideration. Every penny counts!",

In questo periodo √® molto importante limitare la vita sociale, per frenare la diffusione del virus e tornare al pi√π presto alla normalit√†.  Queste precauzioni necessarie hanno purtroppo enormi conseguenze sull'economia locale.   Aiutiamo Firenze a rialzarsi con un \"  caff√®  ¬†virtuale\"!   Anche se non possiamo frequentare fisicamente negozi e locali pubblici con la frequenza di prima, facciamo ugualmente arrivare il nostro sostegno ai commercianti fiorentini!     Doniamo ¬†l'equivalente di un  caff√® , di un  aperitivo , di una  cena , di un  acquisto in un negozio , di tutte quelle cose che avremmo fatto pi√π volte e che anche adesso faremmo volentieri, ma che in questo momento √® prudente ed opportuno limitare.  L'invito a fare sentire la nostra vicinanza e collaborazione responsabile √® rivolto a tutti quelli che vivono o lavorano a Firenze, o che semplicemente vogliono contribuire a sostenere la citt√† in questo momento.  Non ci sono limiti alla somma che √® possibile raccogliere.  Le donazioni saranno fatte pervenire al sindaco Dario Nardella, affinch√© si occupi di farle distribuire nel modo pi√π opportuno agli esercizi pubblici di Firenze.¬†        ----------------------------------------------------  Se volete, aiutateci a diffondere questa campagna sui social, magari usando gli hashtag #caff√®virtualiFirenze e #coronavirusitalia. ----------------------------------------------------  Sarebbe fantastico se poteste aprire  campagne simili per un altro Comune che volete sostenere , sempre usando il titolo \"Caff√® virtuali contro il Coronavirus: (nome del Comune)\".  Prima di aprire una nuova campagna, controllate se qualcuno lo ha gi√† fatto. ¬†Per evitare dispersioni eccessive, √® sensato aprire una campagna per Comune, non per piccoli centri o singoli esercizi.

A friend of mine had told me about a thermal imaging device that captures pictures of that person and gantry control with A.I. which was invented by a Chinese company during this crisis. They are working around the clock to provide to the Chinese government and companies.  It can detect heat signatures over 37 degrees and gives a warning. It can also be incorporated into gantry and autogate systems. Putting up these devices at the entrance of shopping malls, supermarkets, churches can help to detect those people with fever (common symptoms of Coronavirus, SARS, MERS, etc.). Then a security officer can advise the sick to go home and rest.  Places and areas like (trains, buses, restaurants, malls, cinemas, stadiums, etc.) are common spread of viruses to the mass public. So prevention is always better than cure.  Currently, these devices are only in the Chinese language and I have requested them to do an English version. They are too busy to just produce an English unit and send it as a sample. They will provide an update tool (APP) so that I can do changes myself if I make a purchase. The cost of one unit is AUD$4000. So I hoping that through gofundme, I can get these funds to do my first purchase then make the language update and then send out this sample to respective businesses and government agencies for them to test and get them to start helping the general public with better detection.",

            "description": "MILAN ‚Äî The camera focused on a woman reading a prayer for people infected with the coronavirus, and for the doctors and nurses helping Italy deal with the largest outbreak in Europe.  ‚ÄúLord, hear our prayer,‚Äù Julia Kranzelmayer, her husband and three children responded Sunday from the couch of their Milan living room as they followed the Mass on television.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs strange to watch it on TV,‚Äù she said.  In an effort to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, regional officials canceled the public celebration of Mass throughout much of northern Italy, and upended sacred rituals of Italian life.  Soccer players have held matches in¬†empty stadiums. Milan‚Äôs vibrant¬†aperitivo scene has slowed¬†to a halt, and empty trams smell of disinfectant. Ms. Kranzelmayer‚Äôs employer, like many in Lombardy, has ordered its staff to work from home, and her children cannot return to school for at least another week. The¬†coronavirus has infected¬†more than 1,500 people in Italy, with nearly 1,000 of the cases in the Lombardy region in the north, which includes Milan. At least 34 people, almost all elderly or with underlying conditions, have died. Tens of thousands of people in 11 towns are¬†under quarantine¬†in ‚Äúred zones,‚Äù with their loved ones outside¬†forced to drop off cigarettes and care packages¬†for them with authorities, who then deliver the goods.

            "description": "Sono un medico italiano, vivo a Londra e parlo ogni giorno, ormai da settimane, della questione coronavirus con i miei amici pugliesi disperati per ci√≤ che sta accadendo in Italia. L'idea che la nostra terra venga messa in ginocchio da un virus che, ad oggi, non sappiamo come sconfiggere, non ci d√† pace e sentiamo il bisogno di fare qualcosa per aiutare il nostro sistema sanitario e quindi noi stessi.  Leggiamo in questi giorni che gli ospedali  nel sud Italia  non hanno i fondi per affrontare le spese legate a questa imprevista emergenza sanitaria.  Quando i numeri di contagio aumenteranno, i  nostri¬†ospedali  non avranno posti letto per tutti, non ci saranno¬† ventilatori polmonari per tutti i pazienti critici.¬† Presto anche i medici, cos√¨ come sta succedendo nel nord Italia, risulteranno positivi al virus, cos√¨¬† anche i medici, scarseggeranno.¬† Il nostro SUD rischia di non farcela.  Non so quanto, con questo breve messaggio, riusciremo a smuovere lo scetticismo della gente che non crede nelle raccolte fondi, e a fare credere loro che se solo riuscissimo a riunire le forze potremmo fare la differenza.  Non siamo i Ferragnez, lo sappiamo, siamo solo in gruppo di amici e non sappiamo se questo tentativo riuscir√†. Quello che sappiamo¬†√® che l'Italia √® un paese che non si arrende, che gli italiani sono in grado di sorprendere, e che siamo famosi nel mondo per tante ragioni ma la pi√π importante √® che abbiamo un cuore grande.¬†  Non permetteremo al coronavirus di prendersi i nostri cari, le nostre nonne, i nostri pap√†. Non lo permetteremo perch√© insieme possiamo fare la differenza.  Questi soldi serviranno per rinforzare gli ospedali del sud per comprare ventilatori polmonari da donare negli ospedali che cureranno i nostri cari. Forza ragazzi!",

            "description": "The World is under attack from an unseen enemy, called the Coronavirus, also known as the COVID-19 virus. It is no longer a question of ‚Äúif‚Äù but ‚Äúwhen‚Äù Americans will be faced with decisions about whether to work, or self quarantine because they are not feeling well and may have the virus. Many Americans work paycheck to paycheck and missing a minimum 14 days work in order not to spread this virus can have a devastating effect of their everyday lives, not to mention the further spread of this potentially life threatening virus out of desperation.  It is our Mission to help those who have acted responsible under this situation to make the correct choice and self quarantine without fear of falling so far behind that you could end up homeless.¬†Nearly half of¬†Americans live paycheck to paycheck: Bank survey. A near majority of¬†Americans, 49%, are¬†living paycheck to paycheck, according to a new survey by the First National Bank of Omaha. The survey also found that 53% of respondents do not have an emergency fund that covers at least three months of expenses. Are goal is to bring assistance to poor and distressed households that will be effected by this outbreak. By Americans getting involved in this effort we can lesson the burdens of the government.  ¬†We will help all qualified applicants to pay 80% their bills, which will include Rent, or mortgage payments, utilities and bills related medicines to treat this virus.  ¬†By assisting those who cannot afford to simply stay home, which is the low income sectors, like service industry related jobs, manufacturing and construction fields of the American population, we hope to do our part in the containment of this devastating pandemic that has reached our shores.  ¬†It is not simply the responsibility of our government on the local to National levels to work to protect us it is Our responsibility to help ourselves and our Country. If you were suddenly hit with a $500 unexpected bill, would you be able to cover it?  If the answer is no, you're not alone.  ¬†Nearly six in 10 Americans don't have enough savings to cover a $500 or $1,000 unplanned expense, according to a new report from Bankrate.  ¬†Only 41% of adults reported having enough in their savings account to cover a surprise bill of this magnitude. A little more than 20% said they would put it on a credit card, the report said, while 20% would cut their spending and 11% would turn to friends and family for financial assistance.  This is an all hands on battle for our future, the future of our Nation, and¬† possibly the future of humanity. Many people are going become sick, many of them if they have underlying health issues and are elderly may die.¬† Join us, and together we can defeat this pandemic by helping those who are financially unable to help themselves in making the right decision to self-quarantine without fear. We can spend a few pennies today and be proactive or spend huge sums of money to try an catch up. There is no doubt that containment seems to be the key.",

Puoi trovare ulteriori informazioni su di me su  https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreamodenini/   Inutile dire che il Coronavirus (COVID-19) sta diventando un'emergenza globale. A partire da ieri, la mia cara Parma √® entrata nella \"zona rossa\". I miei genitori, entrambi 60enni, lavorano in ospedale e direttamente con pazienti affetti da Coronavirus. Ero senza parole quando mio padre mi disse per telefono:   \"Andrea, in 35 anni di carriera, non ho mai visto una cosa del genere. Non √® una semplice influenza. Stiamo lavorando 12-14 ore al giorno, 7 giorni su 7. Spero che usciremo da questa emergenza. Stiamo esaurendo il personale, i letti per i pazienti, e quant'altro\".   e potete immaginare come ci si puo' sentire impotenti a 1000 km di distanza. Ed √® per questo che sono qui! Sto organizzando questa raccolta fondi per l'Ospedale di Parma appositamente per l'emergenza Coronavirus ( https://www.ao.pr.it/chi-siamo/beneficenza/ ).  Gestir√≤ tutti i documenti (in conformit√† con la legge), vi terr√≤ aggiornatoie ovviamente una volta che avro' raggiunto l'obiettivo, vi fornir√≤ tutta la documentazione della donazione.   Se potete per favore aiutami in questa raccolta, vi prego di donare e condividere con tutti i vostri contatti!   -------------------  ENGLISH  Hi all, ¬†I'm Andrea, an Italian from Parma, living in Netherlands. You can find more about me on   https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreamodenini/    Needless to say that Coronavirus (COVID-19) is becoming a global emergency. Starting from yesterday, my home city Parma entered in the \"red zone\", meaning no entry nor exit. My parents, both 60 years old, work at the Hospital and they are working directly in the division for treating patients affected by Coronavirus. I was speechless when my father told me with his own words by telephone the following:  \" Andrea, in 35 years of career, I've never seen something like that.¬† It's not just a simple flu. We're working 12-14 hours/day, 7/7. I hope we're gonna get out of this emergency. We're running out of personnel, beds for patients, etc. \"  and you can imagine feeling 1000 km away powerless.¬† And that's why I'm here! I'm raising a funding for the Parma Hospital specifically for Coronavirus emergency (  https://www.ao.pr.it/chi-siamo/beneficenza/  ).  I will manage all the paperwork (in compliance to Italian law), keep you posted, and obviously once reached the target I will provide proof of the donation.

Covid-19 non guarda in faccia a nessuno.¬†  Questa situazione √® senza precedenti in epoca moderna e sta avendo numerose ripercussioni a livello sociale ed economico. Tuttavia sta avendo anche un altro tipo di risvolto: sta portando alla luce nuovi aspetti delle persone, nel bene e nel male.  Nel male ha suscitato: psicosi di massa, supermercati saccheggiati, disinformazione, minimizzazione o negazione del problema, esodi sconsiderati di persone potenzialmente infette, paura, odio ed episodi di razzismo.  Nel bene tuttavia: ha portato le persone a documentarsi, il servizio sanitario, tanto spesso criticato con leggerezza, ha reagito in maniera estremamente efficace con i mezzi a disposizione, molte strutture sono state potenziate, ha sensibilizzato molte persone ad azioni di solidariet√† e di prevenzione, ha fatto prendere coscienza a molti di quanto i nostri operatori sanitari, forze dell'ordine e tanti altri si adoperino quotidianamente per la comunit√†. E ci sono state anche tante altre reazioni positive a livello personale e sociale, l'elenco potrebbe essere lungo.  Tuttavia ancora non basta: l'emergenza esiste, ed √® di portata davvero straordinaria. Il nostro sistema sanitario non √® in grado di reggere la pressione che questa situazione sta portando n√® a livello di personale, n√® a livello di strutture (inteso come posti in rianimazione e terapia intensiva), n√® a livello di attrezzature.¬†  Sia chiaro: io sono uno qualsiasi, come tanti di voi che. Sono uno che ha sempre cercato di trasmettere agli altri dei messaggi positivi e, nel suo piccolo, di fare qualcosa di buono per gli altri.¬† Sto vivendo questa situazione da vicino perch√® la mia compagna √® medico rianimatore, quindi sono sensibile a ci√≤ che vive lei, ma prima di tutto sono una persona che sta cercando di capire cosa sta succedendo. Sono uno che, come voi, sta vivendo questa epoca strana, in cui c'√® tanta confusione.  Forse √® una metafora un po' forte, ma possiamo dire che sono giorni in cui la Morte cammina per le strade, va al cinema, va nelle scuole, prende la metropolitana, va in ufficio... fa una vita qualsiasi, una vita come quella di tanti di noi.  E, percorrendo le nostre stesse strade, vivendo la nostra quotidianit√†, pu√≤ incrociarci in qualsiasi momento e decidere di baciarci... un bacio freddo, che toglie il respiro. Ma non te ne accorgi subito e magari, nel frattempo, quel bacio tu lo dai alla tua compagna, ai tuoi genitori, ai tuoi figli...  Eppure ancora c'√® tanta disinformazione in merito, tanto menefreghismo, tanta superficialit√†.  Oggi riflettevo sul fatto che se ognuno di noi diffondesse della buona informazione a chi gli sta intorno, si potrebbe riuscire ad arginare la diffusione del virus.¬† Da qui il passo √® stato breve e mi sono chiesto: \"ma se ognuno di noi mettesse un nichelino, non si potrebbe aiutare il sistema sanitario con delle attrezzature o qualcosa in pi√π?\" Nell'era dei social abbiamo la possibilit√† di avere la giusta diffusione e uno strumento magnifico come il crowdfunding per permettere a tutti di contribuire.  Cos√¨ ho deciso di provarci, di fare il passo e fare qualcosa di concreto e permettere ad altri di aiutarmi, di aiutarci l'un l'altro  La somma che ho scelto non √® stata calcolata su budget o conti scientifici e, oggettivamente, non so quanto possa influire in una battaglia su questa scala.  Ma penso sia comunque un gesto importante, che pu√≤ permettere a tante persone di fare qualcosa, di agire. Ogni azione comporta un cambiamento, per quanto piccola. E' il cosiddetto \"effetto farfalla\".  Proviamoci... anche se possono sembrare gesti piccoli, facciamoli!  Dopo tutto, mettendo insieme delle gocce si pu√≤ formare una pozzanghera, ma anche un oceano!  Fatelo! Facciamolo!¬†  Per noi, per le persone a cui teniamo... e anche per tutti gli altri in fondo! Perch√®, in qualche modo, tutta questa storia ci pu√≤ unire! E penso che questa sia la cosa pi√π fantastica che pu√≤ venire da tutta questa confusione. Il fatto di vincerla ed uscirne pi√π uniti di prima. Non come nazione, o come identit√† culturale, ma come PERSONE!  Io ci provo. Sono uno di voi. Aiutiamoci!  Grazie a tutti!

            "description": " Story   In December, our well pump died and we‚Äôve been without running water ever since. We're raising $1500 to replace the well and $500 to survive until we can get it replaced.   We‚Äôve been using bottled water, but it‚Äôs expensive and hard to deal with. We‚Äôre both disabled and this a big hardship for us.   [Image by  Willfried Wende  from  Pixabay ]  Now people have been buying out all the bottled water stock at our local stores in preparation for a COVID19 outbreak, and it will be much harder for us to source potable water.  The replacements we use in lieu of running water, like bathing wipes, dry shampoo, bottled drinks and disposable utensils, are not good for us, our finances, or the environment.    [Image by  Bilderjet  from  Pixabay ]  Please help us fix our well so we can go back to living more normal lives.   Thank you for your donations and for sharing our fundraiser! With your help we can get this done.   [Image by  Susanne Jutzeler, suju-foto ¬† from  Pixabay ]   Costs   We estimate that the well repair will be about $1500 including a new pump and labor. We‚Äôve included an extra $500 in the goal to help us buy the things we need in the meantime, which will be a lot of disposable utensils and ready made meals since we have no way to wash dishes.    Risks   It‚Äôs possible that the repairs will be more expensive than my estimate, but that seems unlikely.   It's also possible that we won't raise enough money to replace the pump and we won't be able to make up the difference for a while.    Notes   Title Image by  Ron Porter  from  Pixabay .   I hope we can update the campaign with images from our own lives soon. I just wanted to get this live as soon as possible so that we can get water again.",

            "description": "\r\n Amici piemontesi, anche il  Piemonte ¬†√® vittima dall‚Äôepidemia di   Covid-19   che il nostro Paese sta patendo. Ho deciso di creare questa campagna di raccolta fondi per aiutare una delle strutture ospedaliere che si sta battendo per dare assistenza medica ai malati, non solo di coronavirus, sul nostro territorio.  \r\n \r\n\r\n In questo sito trovate i riferimenti per le donazioni da cui potrete trovare anche il  CCP  legato a questa raccolta fondi:\r\n \r\n\r\n   http://www.sanluigi.piemonte.it/enti/sl_onlus.shtml  ¬†\r\n \r\n\r\n  L‚ÄôOspedale San Luigi Gonzaga \r\n \r\n\r\n L'inizio della storia del \"San Luigi Gonzaga\" ha una data precisa: il 26 Marzo 1818. Quel giorno, alla presenza del Re e delle autorit√† del Comune iniziarono i lavori dell'Ospedale \"specializzato\" nella cura dei malati polmonari, all'epoca, per la maggior parte, affetti da tubercolosi. L'esigenza di un ospedale specializzato venne recepita dall'Opera Pia San Luigi Gonzaga.   L'Ospedale sorse nel 1826, in una sede che non era quella attuale. Originariamente, infatti, si trovava a Torino, in zona Valdocco, nell'attuale sede dell'Archivio di Stato. Il luogo per la nuova costruzione fu individuato tra Via delle Ghiacciaie, Via del Deposito, Via Santa Chiara e Strada Valdocco, rispettivamente le attuali Via Giulio, Via Piave, Via Santa Chiara e Corso Valdocco.   Il progetto venne affidato a Giuseppe Maria TALUCCHI, tra i pochi esponenti del Neoclassicismo Piemontese, che realizz√≤, tra l'altro, la facciata e la rotonda del cortile dell'Accademia Albertina, il completamento del Collegio dei Nobili del Guarini, in un secondo tempo sede dell'Accademia delle Scienze, nonch√® il portale d'ingresso dell'Universit√† di Via Verdi.  Nel 1903 l'Ospedale raggiunse la capienza massima di 243 posti letto; tuttavia i progressi continui della scienza nella cura delle malattie polmonari indussero l'Amministrazione a non realizzare ulteriori ampliamenti, ma a costruire un nuovo ospedale destinato unicamente alla cura dei malati affetti da tubercolosi.  La prima pietra del nuovo Ospedale venne posta nel 1904, mentre il trasferimento da Regione Valdocco al modernissimo sanatorio suburbano di 1000 posti letti nella zona di Corso Orbassano a Torino, attuale sede dello stabilimento FIAT Mirafiori, avviene nel 1909. Il nuovo ospedale San Luigi Gonzaga nacque cos√¨ in localit√† Tre Tetti, un agglomerato di tre casette ad un piano che interrompeva il deserto stradone che portava ad Orbassano.  Nel 1970, infine, l'Ospedale San Luigi Gonzaga venne nuovamente trasferito, andando ad occupare l'attuale sede. L'originaria valenza di sanatorio si evince, infatti, dalla struttura a padiglioni, con ampi terrazzi soleggiati e lunghi corridoi di collegamento, oltre che dal vastissimo parco che circonda l'Ospedale.  All'inizio degli anni '90, l'insediamento dell'Universit√† degli Studi di Torino, attraverso l'acquisizione di alte professionalit√†, ha prodotto un significativo ampliamento delle competenze e delle specialit√† dando un forte impulso alla vita dell'ospedale. Di conseguenza, da prettamente pneumologico, il San Luigi si √® trasformato in un moderno complesso polispecialistico.  Negli anni successivi, l'istituzione del II Corso di Laurea in Medicina e Chirurgia, del Corso di Laurea in Infermieristica (C.L.I.) e di alcune Scuole di Specializzazione post-laurea hanno ulteriormente ampliato la collaborazione tra Universit√† e Ospedale consentendo di raggiungere elevati livelli di sviluppo attraverso l'integrazione tra ricerca scientifica, assistenza e formazione professionale, caratterizzando l'Ospedale, nel frattempo divenuto \"Azienda Sanitaria Ospedaliera\" a rilevanza nazionale, quale vero e proprio \"Ospedale di insegnamento\".  Con D.P.G.R. n¬∞ 99 del 17 dicembre 2007, l'Azienda Sanitaria Ospedaliera San Luigi Gonzaga, ha assunto, dal primo gennaio 2008, la qualificazione di \"Azienda Ospedaliero Universitaria\".  L'Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria San Luigi Gonzaga si caratterizza per attivit√† medico-chirurgiche che la pongono in posizione di rilievo nell'ambito del panorama sanitario piemontese.  L'iniziale vocazione al trattamento delle patologie polmonari √® stata, nel corso degli anni, oggetto di profonde trasformazioni evolutive che hanno condotto il \"San Luigi\" ad un presente ed un futuro fortemente caratterizzati da un'offerta di interventi sanitari polispecialistici ad alto contenuto qualitativo.  Si evidenziano, sempre all'interno della struttura ospedaliera, il Centro Regionale Antidoping \"Alessandro Bertinaria\", realizzato in occasione delle Olimpiadi Invernali \"Torino 2006\" e destinato a rappresentare un centro di eccellenza e formazione nel campo della Tossicologia ed il Centro di ricerca di Neuroscienze della Fondazione Cavalieri Ottolenghi, di recente inaugurazione.  Dal 1¬∞ ottobre 2008, la struttura sanitaria √® sede della Facolt√† di Medicina e Chirurgia San Luigi Gonzaga. Questo risultato √® frutto della forte collaborazione tra Azienda Sanitaria ed Universit√†, che ha portato al conseguimento di risultati scientifici di elevato livello ed, in particolare, allo sviluppo e all'integrazione tra ricerca scientifica, assistenza sanitaria e formazione, tutti mirati al raggiungimento di un unico obiettivo primario: la cura del paziente.\r\n ",

It is the eighth coronavirus recognized as capable of infecting humans. The official name given by the World Health Organization to the syndrome caused by the virus is COVID-19 (abbreviation of the English COronaVIrus Disease-2019).

This virus, currently still under study, is compared to SARS and has a mortality rate which is still uncertain due to the transitory phase of contagion that is still ongoing.

The Corona Virus effects us all in some shape,way, or form. Families ¬†work as hard as they can to support their families and many can‚Äôt afford to be isolated in their homes for 14 days or longer with out working. Millions of people live on a fixed income and need to work so they can feed their families and have a roof over their head. Missing 14 days or more without income can be a catastrophic impact to them. Life is hard already imagine being isolated and scared because you have the corona virus and now you have to also worry about not having any funds to pay your bills. So we need to take action before it‚Äôs to late. So Lenders Loan Capital has removed its life time membership fee of $150 for those that donate $20 to the fund relief of the outbreak. Also, ¬†Lenders Loan Capital is donating 10 percent of all ¬†clients that get funding though our company. Please anything you can spare will help families that are impacted by the Global Pandemic of the Corona Virus. This effects all of us globally. It will effect you and to know that there‚Äôs a fund established to help you and your family financially is a big relief. We can‚Äôt help everyone but, with your support and donations together we can help as many as families as possible. Thank You for your support and our hearts go out to you and your families.",

This has generated a lot of issues as hospitals are overcrowded and resources are running low. It is a well known fact that doctors and nurses are working non stop for 20 hours a day and now have to choose who has the the ‚Äò‚Äôpriority‚Äô‚Äô to be saved and who has to die, meaning that elderly people and people with immunodeficencies will no longer be cared for. People we know are also dying because of issues not related to CoronaVirus as there isn‚Äôt enough room and resources for everybody.¬† Unfortunately many people still believe that this is an over reaction but this is really happening and probably going to spread. I thought I should start a fundraise in order to give back and support my community, making it easy for people with UK Bank accounts to donate without occurring in too many expenses.¬† Recently, ¬†FONDAZIONE COMUNITA‚Äô BRESCIANA ONLUS started to fundraise in order to support our community and hospitals. At the moment it is easy for Italian bank account holders, so I opened this GoFundPage so I can simply do an international Bank Transfer to them and help in any way possible, even from abroad!¬† Just to clarify, I am not working FOR them as I spoke to them earlier and they are working on a system which will enable people from all over the world to donate in a faster and more affordable way then the one they are offering at the moment, so I thought to jump in and do the best as I can while we wait. Not being able to go home now is necessary but painful, but in the meantime I just cannot sit here without doing nothing.¬†  Literally any ¬£ counts and it is important that this gets shared, even if you cannot donate anything.¬† You can see their official page here:   http://www.fondazionebresciana.org/news/aperta-la-raccolta-fondi-per-sostenere-gli-ospedali-bresciani-aiutiamobrescia/  ¬†  but it is in Italian at the moment.¬†  Let‚Äôs stand together  3¬† #AIUTIAMOBRESCIA #HELPFORBRESCIA¬†  PS: I don‚Äôt own the picture, I found it on google.

De huidige regels bij bloed doneren (uitstel na bezoek aan risicogebied, geen gezondheidsklachten bij donatie) werken goed en worden wanneer nodig aangevuld. Zo voorkomen wij dat donors bij de Bloedbank anderen besmetten. We zouden het heel erg waarderen als u een bedrag doneert.  The corona virus has been detected in the Netherlands, Belgium and several European countries. The measures to prevent further contamination seem to work well. The current blood donation rules (postponement after a visit to the risk area, no health problems with donations) work well and are supplemented when necessary. This way we prevent donors at the Blood Bank from infecting others. We would really appreciate it if you donate an amount",

Every single penny will go directly to those in need. Hopefully we‚Äôll be able to donate UK wide by donating to national charities.

Medici, infermieri e scienziati stanno facendo un lavoro importantissimo per curare persone affette da Covid-19 e non solo (i malati e gli incidenti di tutti i giorni esistono sempre purtroppo!)e vorrei supportarli concretamente.  Vedo che numerose strutture stanno mettendo a disposizione iban per effettuare bonifici, ma credo che questa via sia molto pi√π rapida e possa aiutare anche le strutture pi√π piccole che ci aiutano in questo momento.  Per questo motivo ho pensato di aiutare l' Ospedale di Bergamo \"Papa Giovanni XXIII\" per la fornitura e la realizzazione di sale di terapia intensiva. In questo momento le attrezzature necessarie per triplicare i posti letto di terapia intensiva e sub-intensiva sono:¬† - Ventilatori - Dispositivi di ventilazione non invasiva - Monitoraggio emodinamico - Monitor¬†   Anche una piccola donazione pu√≤ fare la differenza.   I fondi raccolti saranno direttamente devoluti all'Ospedale di Bergamo Papa Giovanni XXIII.  ............................................................................................................................................   APPEAL TO ALL THE PEOPLE OF BERGAMO AND ITALY!   In this very delicate phase, from a social and health point of view, we can also do something.  Doctors, nurses and scientists are doing a very important job to treat people affected by Covid-19 and not only (the sick and everyday accidents always exist unfortunately!) and I would like to support them concretely.  I see that a lot of facilities are providing iban to make transfers, but I believe that this way is much faster and can help even the smallest facilities that help us at the moment.  For this reason I thought to help the 'Hospital of Bergamo \"Pope John XXIII\" for the supply and construction of intensive care rooms. In this moment the necessary equipment to triple the beds of intensive and sub-intensive therapy are:¬† - Ventilators - Non-invasive ventilation devices - Hemodynamic monitoring - Monitor¬†  Even a small donation can make a difference.  The funds raised will be directly donated to the Hospital of Bergamo Pope John XXIII.  ............................................................................................................................................   APPELLIEREN AN ALLE MENSCHEN IN BERGAMO UND ITALIEN!   In dieser aus sozialer und gesundheitlicher Sicht sehr heiklen Phase k√∂nnen wir auch etwas tun.  √Ñrzte, Krankenschwestern und Wissenschaftler leisten eine sehr wichtige Arbeit bei der Behandlung von Menschen, die von Covid-19 und nicht nur (die Kranken und allt√§glichen Unf√§lle gibt es leider immer!) betroffen sind, und ich m√∂chte sie konkret unterst√ºtzen.  Ich sehe, dass viele Einrichtungen Iban anbieten, um Transfers durchzuf√ºhren, aber ich glaube, dass dieser Weg viel schneller ist und selbst den kleinsten Einrichtungen helfen kann, die uns im Moment helfen.  Aus diesem Grund dachte ich daran, dem \"Krankenhaus von Bergamo \"Papst Johannes XXIII.\" bei der Lieferung und dem Bau von Intensivstationen zu helfen. In diesem Moment sind die notwendigen Ger√§te zur Verdreifachung der Betten f√ºr die intensive und subintensive Therapie vorhanden:¬† - Beatmungsger√§te - Nicht-invasive Beatmungsger√§te - H√§modynamische √úberwachung - √úberwachen Sie¬†  Selbst eine kleine Spende kann einen Unterschied machen.  Die gesammelten Gelder werden direkt an das Krankenhaus von Papst Johannes XXIII. von Bergamo gespendet.  ............................................................................................................................................   APELA A TODO EL PUEBLO DE BERGAMO E ITALIA!   En esta fase tan delicada, desde el punto de vista social y sanitario, tambi√©n podemos hacer algo.  Los m√©dicos, enfermeras y cient√≠ficos est√°n haciendo un trabajo muy importante para tratar a las personas afectadas por el Covid-19 y no s√≥lo (¬°los enfermos y los accidentes cotidianos siempre existen, por desgracia!) y me gustar√≠a apoyarlos concretamente.  Veo que muchas instalaciones est√°n proporcionando iban para hacer transferencias, pero creo que esta forma es mucho m√°s r√°pida y puede ayudar incluso a las instalaciones m√°s peque√±as que nos ayudan en este momento.  Por eso pens√© en ayudar al Hospital de B√©rgamo \"Papa Juan XXIII\" para el suministro y la construcci√≥n de salas de cuidados intensivos. En este momento el equipo necesario para triplicar las camas de terapia intensiva y subintensiva son:¬† - Ventiladores - Dispositivos de ventilaci√≥n no invasiva - Monitoreo hemodin√°mico - Monitor¬†  Incluso una peque√±a donaci√≥n puede hacer la diferencia.  Los fondos recaudados ser√°n donados directamente al Hospital de B√©rgamo Papa Juan XXIII.",

Insieme a Dario, Massimiliano e Filippo abbiamo deciso di unirci perch√©  vogliamo creare una raccolta fondi per gli Ospedali di Modena e Reggio Emilia, cos√¨ da poterli sostenere nelle spese da affrontare per il corona virus COVID19.   Simone √® stato il pi√π veloce: ha creato questa raccolta ed il gruppo facebook¬† Zona Rossa Responsabile,  Dario, Massimiliano e Filippo si sono uniti subito ed intorno a noi si sono raccolte in pochi giorni oltre 4000 persone.   Se vuoi sapere altro su di noi puoi verificare di persona contattandoci in ogni momento, qui o sui social.   Ora per√≤ parliamo di solidariet√†, che √® al centro del nostro progetto.   Il nostro obiettivo √®  affrontare in modo responsabile l'emergenza corona virus , fornendo supporto a distanza, informazioni, consigli ed idee per affrontare l'emergenza, resistere e uscirne pi√π forti.   Vogliamo trasformare queste lunghe giornate di fermo ¬† in un'ondata di energia positiva .  Vogliamo  sostenere le persone e le istituzioni delle nostre comunit√† .  La prima azione √® raccogliere fondi per  sostenere i reparti di terapia intensiva degli ospedali di Modena e  Reggio Emilia.   Come sai questi reparti sono alle prese con una mole di lavoro senza uguali, e noi possiamo  aiutarli solo in due modi: stando a casa e agendo da qui.  Una tua semplice donazione contribuir√† a sostenere la nostra campagna: il denaro che donerai verr√† interamente devoluto ai reparti di Terapia Intensiva delle Aziende Ospedaliere di Modena e Reggio Emilia.  Le donazioni verranno prelevate direttamente dalle Direzioni degli Ospedali, in modo tale da renderle fruibili senza procedure complicate o passaggi intermedi, cos√¨ come permette il sito GoFundMe.   Siamo in contatto con le direzioni di entrambi gli ospedali al fine di gestire al meglio la donazioni e comunicheremo in maniera puntuale e trasparente tutte le informazioni sui profili social del gruppo.   Questo appello √® dunque rivolto a te, a tutti i cittadini e all'intera comunit√† e  fa leva sul sentimento della solidariet√†: attraverso lo sforzo congiunto di tutti si possono mettere in campo azioni straordinarie in grado di accelerare il superamento di questo momento di crisi.¬†   Ti chiediamo di donare quello che ritieni opportuno: anche il contributo¬† pi√π piccolo √® infatti fondamentale per raggiungere l'obiettivo che ci siamo dati tutti insieme.   Ti chiediamo anche di aiutarci a condividere la nostra campagna: ogni tua condivisione sui social o su whatsapp aiuter√† il nostro progetto a crescere.   Fin da ora vogliamo dirti GRAZIE.    GRAZIE per la tua fiducia, e per la tua donazione.   GRAZIE per condividere la nostra iniziativa.   GRAZIE per aiutarci a raggiungere, insieme questo grande obiettivo.    Insieme a te ci riusciremo.    Andr√† Tutto Bene    Grazie di cuore.   Simone Ruscetta, Dario, Massimiliano e tutte le persone di Zona Rossa Responsabile.    \r\n ",

Il contagio da COVID-19 sta avanzando in maniera esponenziale ed i reparti di terapia intensiva della nostra regione sono in crisi, per sovraffollamento e impotenza di fronte a una velocit√† di propagazione del virus.

TUTTO IL RICAVATO sar√† devoluto completamente all'ospedale Amedeo di Savoia di Torino, unit√† di terapia intensiva.   Il ricavato sar√† versato, tramite bonifico bancario, direttamente sul conto dell'ospedale, che provveder√† a destinare il denaro nel miglior modo possibile (attrezzatura, posti letto e ricerca).

            "description": "   Emergenza COVID19, Marzo 2020   Come sappiamo l'emergenza Corona Virus sta attanagliando l'Italia, numerose campagne si sono aperte per sostenere gli ospedali ed i reparti di terapia intensiva ottenendo grandi risultati.   Un bisogno concreto per√≤ √® necessario anche nelle piccole e medie associazioni di volontariato  che ogni giorno prestano mezzi e volontari al servizio del sistema sanitario italiano, auto-sostenenendosi grazie alle donazioni dei cittadini delle citt√† e dei piccoli paesi dove queste operano.   Ogni giorno sempre pi√π dispositivi di protezione individuale vengono acquistati ed utilizzati , sono dispositivi monouso che quindi vanno eliminati al termine di ogni servizio di assistenza sanitaria di emergenza.  Questo comporta per le associazioni un'enorme spesa da sostenere  per garantire ai propri volontari mascherine, occhiali, tute, calzari, cuffie e guanti, riuscendo cos√¨ a tenere il servizio di emergenza-urgenza attivo 24 ore su 24 che altrimenti verrebbe sospeso per tutelare la salute di chi gratuitamente si presta all'aiuto affrontando un pericolo che √® reale e va preso seriamente.   Con una donazione anche di pochi euro si aiutano queste Onlus a sostenere i costi che in questi giorni si sono moltiplicati , dovuti all'acquisto e smaltimento di dispositivi di protezione, ma anche nuovi mezzi, con tutte le spese che ne conseguono come carburante, assicurazioni, dotazioni ecc.  As we know, the Corona Virus emergency is gripping Italy, numerous campaigns have opened to support hospitals and intensive care units, achieving great results.   A concrete need, however, is also necessary in small and medium-sized voluntary associations  that every day provide ambulances and volunteers to serve the Italian health system, self-sustaining thanks to the donations of citizens of the cities and small towns where they operate.  Every day more and more personal protective equipment is purchased and used, they are disposable devices which must therefore be eliminated at the end of each emergency health care service.  This entails a huge expense for associations to be incurred  to guarantee their volunteers masks, goggles, protective suits, boots and gloves, thus managing to keep the emergency-urgency service active 24 hours a day which would otherwise be suspended to protect the health of those who freely lend themselves to help by facing a danger that is real and must be taken seriously.   With a donation of even a few euros, these non-profit organizations help to bear the costs that have multiplied in these days,  due to the purchase and disposal of protective devices, but also new ambulances, with all the consequent expenses such as fuel, insurance , equipment etc.",

The Italian country, the cities and the small and medium-sized businesses that are part of it were not prepared. We are on our knees.¬†  Panic, fear and frustrations is what we feel.¬†  That‚Äôs why is time to erase our hand and think about the future. For everyone, for our country, our families  Now union¬† is strength.  But Every Single Person can make a difference.¬†  Do you to be the one that can make that difference?  During these days we are collecting the help requests. And we would love to have a small capital  to support those who do not have the opportunity to do it with their own resources (some activities are closed already).  The funds raised will be distributed in percentages after the necessary proof.¬†  The money will go towards the payment of rents, contributions, wages, damaged goods, suppliers,ecc.  The feeling that your actions can be a concrete help for you and the people around you is a matter of shared responsibility.¬†¬†  Think about that.¬†  -  Siamo tutti dei grandi lavoratori, sempre con il sorriso stampato sul viso, ogni giorno.   Non eravamo pronti per√≤ all‚Äôormai famoso COVID-19 che oltre a portare vittime e paura ci sta trascinando a fondo con grandissime difficolt√† economiche per tutti noi che difficilmente riusciremo a contrastare senza il vostro aiuto.    Chiedo a gran voce, parlando per tutti i commercianti , un vostro aiuto per poter salvare le nostre imprese, le nostre case e le nostre famiglie.  I soldi andranno per il pagamento di affitti, contributi, stipendi, merce danneggiata, fornitori.  ¬† INSIEME SIAMO TUTTI PI√ô FORTI!  ¬† L‚Äôintera raccolta fondi andr√† in giusta percentuale per chiunque ne avesse bisogno con prove verificate delle difficolt√† economiche.",

            "description": "Wir, Arnt (57 Jahre alt) und Angela (55 Jahre alt), ben√∂tigen dringend eure/Ihre Unterst√ºtzung. Wir stecken mitten im Schlammassel.¬†    Tja, wie erkl√§rt man das. Jeder wei√ü es inzwischen. Covid-19, der Coronavirus h√§lt f√ºr uns tagt√§glich negative Nachrichten bereit. Es ist dramatisch, was sich gerade weltweit abspielt. Die Sanktionen der Bundesregierung zwingen uns wirtschaftlich deutlich in die Knie. Alle Veranstaltungen mit Tausend Besuchern und mehr sind f√ºr's erste gestrichen. Uns fliegen die Absagen gerade m√§chtig um die Ohren.¬†  Und wir schieben einen riesigen Kostenapparat vor uns her. Gerade unsere laufenden Kosten erdr√ºcken uns. Wir sitzen wie das Kaninchen vor der Schlange und k√∂nnen rein gar nichts tun. F√ºr uns, als Unternehmen, ist die Entwicklung von Covid-19 eine Katastrophe!¬†  Jahresanfang sind uns die Veranstaltungen weggebrochen, weil ein Sturm nach dem anderen √ºber unser Land hinweggefegt ist. Und nun ist es Covid-19, dass Veranstaltungen gar nicht erst stattfinden.¬†  Aber mal zu uns... wir bauen uns seit nunmehr 10 Jahren eine Existenz auf. Viele Tiefschl√§ge (Abbruch Rock am Ring wegen Unwetter, ein anderes Mal Teilabbruch wegen Terrorwarnung, Hurricane-Festival Abbruch wegen Unwetter usw.) warfen uns immer wieder derbe zur√ºck.      Doch wir sind unserem Ziel treu geblieben und haben weitergek√§mpft.  Wir haben uns einst f√ºr unsere mobilen Gastronomie, der sau-saugut, ¬†entschieden, weil es so viel nicht schmeckendes und undefinierbares Zeugs auf Veranstaltungen gab. Wir wollten es besser machen, als alle anderen. Wir wollten haupts√§chlich unsere G√§ste gl√ºcklich machen.  Und wir schafften etwas, worin wir wirklich einzigartig sind. Tausende stehen j√§hrlich vor unserem Stand und fotografieren unser Produkt! Diese Begeisterung unserer G√§ste und Besucher, das ist so einmalig und ist so tief ergreifend! Von all den G√§sten zu schweigen, die zur√ºck kommen, um uns zu sagen, wie grandios die \"Sau vom Spie√ü\" war.    Wir ticken dazu anders als die Meisten. Uns geht es haupts√§chlich um die Liebe zum Produkt und der Freude, die wir erzeugen, wenn es unseren G√§sten schmeckt. Unsere Zubereitung ist oft umst√§ndlich und zeitaufw√§ndiger... in der Zeit verdienen andere schon ihr Geld. Doch wir verzichten lieber auf den ein oder anderen Cent, bieten aber unseren G√§sten daf√ºr ein qualitatives, hochwertiges, urspr√ºngliches und frisch zubereitetes Essen, das durch seinen unverwechselbaren Geschmack noch lange in dessen Erinnerung bleibt.  Mit der puren Gaumenfreude - quasi dem Erleben urspr√ºnglich, zubereiteter Produkte, beginnt bei uns und unseren G√§sten das Interesse und die Wertsch√§tzung f√ºr das Produkt. Wir wollen niemanden bekehren, alles auf dieser Welt hat seine Berechtigung. Wir erg√§nzen nur die Vielfalt an M√∂glichkeiten dadurch, dass wir auf urspr√ºngliche Zubereitung setzen - es forcieren - ja zelebrieren und nur aus einem Grund: weil es uns Spa√ü macht!  Wir leben auf einem Hof in Norddeutschland. Hof, weil wir das zur√ºckgezogene, l√§ndliche Leben lieben. Aber insbesondere auch, weil wir die Fl√§chen ben√∂tigen, um all unser Equipment unterzubringen. Unser Scheune und St√§lle steht voll. Wir besitzen sogar ein eigenes K√ºhlhaus, um unsere Lebensmittel ordentlich zu lagern. Unsere obere Etage im Wohnhaus nutzen wir f√ºr unsere B√ºros. Darin erledigen wir die anfallenden B√ºroarbeiten, wie unsere Buchhaltung, das Marketing und Organisation s√§mtlicher Veranstaltungen.¬†  Seit Anbeginn unserer Firma sind wir nie in den Urlaub gefahren. Wir leben alles andere, als auf gro√üem Fu√ü. Unsere Leidenschaft, ist unsere sau-saugut. Alles was wir verdienen, wird in unsere Firma reinvestiert, um sie noch innovativer zu gestalten.¬†  Unser neuer Verkaufsstand, den wir im letzten Jahr gebaut haben.¬†    Seit vielen Jahren setzt das Nachrichtenmagazin DER SPIEGEL, auf unsere Kochk√ºnste. Wir richten mit ihnen zusammen das j√§hrliche Sommerfest aus. Farin Urlaub, von den √Ñrzten, hat √ºber uns, direkt auf der B√ºhne und vor vielen Tausend Menschen, ein Lied gesungen und das Publikum skandieren lassen. Campino von den √Ñrzten hat, aus lauter Begeisterung, unsere Preisschilder signiert. Wir sind so extrem beliebt und wir werden geliebt, f√ºr das, was wir tun.¬†  Schaut euch mal das  Video ¬† von Farin an, das brodelt im Kessel, das kann ich euch/Ihnen sagen! Da bekommt man G√§nsehaus!  Und nun soll das in ein paar Wochen einfach alles verpufft sein? Unsere gesamte M√ºhe ist dann v√∂llig umsonst gewesen? Wir sind auch nicht mehr in dem Alter, um neu anfangen zu k√∂nnen.¬†  Wenn unsere sau-saugut den Bach runter geht, werden wir, neben unserem private Desaster, Insolvenz anmelden m√ºssen und alles verlieren. Und davon erholen wir uns im Leben nicht mehr! Das kostet uns unseren Hof, unser Equipment, die Verkaufsst√§nde, unseren Fuhrpark und alles was wir besitzen. Ist das erst einmal alles unter dem Hammer, gibt es keinen Neuanfang mehr f√ºr uns. Schon allein ein Grill, weil es sich um Sonderanfertigungen handelt, kostet uns 7.000 Euro und wir besitzen drei davon, um alle Veranstaltungen bedienen zu k√∂nnen.¬†  Unsere gro√üartigen und langj√§hrigen Mitarbeiter sind gottlob bis aufs Weitere gesichert, sie beziehen Arbeitslosenunterst√ºtzung und warten auf uns.¬†  Doch unsere laufenden Kosten warten nicht, sie werden immer fordernder. Staatliche Hilfe wird es wahrscheinlich eingeschr√§nkt f√ºr uns geben, aber nicht zeitnah, wenn es f√ºr uns √ºberhaupt welche gibt.  Wir k√∂nnen aber nicht l√§nger warten. Wir brauchen dringend Ihre/Eure Unterst√ºtzung. Wir m√ºssen es schaffen, uns die n√§chsten drei bis vier Monate √ºber Wasser halten zu k√∂nnen.¬†  Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel best√§tigt heute unsere Bef√ºrchtungen, dass wir noch Wochen mit jeglicher Unterbrechung von Veranstaltungen rechnen m√ºssen.   Uns wird dadurch jegliche M√∂glichkeit entzogen, arbeiten zu k√∂nnen. Das ist auch nicht mit einem Job auffangbar. Mal ganz davon abgesehen, dass es schwierig wird, einen Arbeitgeber davon zu √ºberzeugen, dass wir nur ein paar Monate bleiben werden. ¬†  Unsere Unkosten wie Miete, Strom, Versicherungsbeitr√§ge, Steuer, Krankenkassen, Telefone, Netzbeitr√§ge, Verbindlichkeiten Bank, Standplatzgelder und schlussendlich unser Grundlebensunterhalt ¬†laufen weiter und erdr√ºcken uns zunehmend.  Bitte helft uns und unterst√ºtzt uns!¬†  Jeder von euch, aber wirklich jedem sichern wir heute schon zu, wenn die sau-saugut √ºberlebt, dann sind Sie herzlichst dazu eingeladen, bei uns zu essen und das auf Lebenszeit!¬†  Unsere Lage ist wirklich sehr ernst!  Bleibt gesund und passt auf euch auf!",

In un momento di emergenza come quella che stiamo affrontando oggi, medici, infermieri e personale ospedaliero stanno svolgendo tutto ci√≤ che in loro potere.    Facciamo la nostra parte : aiutiamoli con un piccolo contributo. La donazione minima √® 5 ‚Ç¨.¬† Tutte le cifre sono importanti.    Ci teniamo a sottolineare che la procedura di trasferimento delle donazioni raccolte fino ad ora √® stata avviata tramite l'Ufficio di Internal Auditing dell'Ospedale.   Aiutateci a raggiungere questo obiettivo.   Vi ringraziamo sinceramente.  ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†____________________________________________________________________________________________  We are a group of students  strictly in contact  with the hospital of our city: Ospedale Maggiore di Parma.   We decided to create a fundraiser campaign to support the intensive care unit in our hospital, critically hit by the Covid-19 emergency.   In this very moment, our doctors, nurses and health care workers are working hard for us, for our family and friends.   Let‚Äôs do our best and support them!  Minimum donation is 5‚Ç¨. Even a small donation can make an impact.   The donation procedure has started! We are working with the Internal Auditing department of the hospital.   Help us reach our goal.  Thank you for your support.",
